<h3>General Terms and Conditions</h3>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="access-to-the-services">
<p><strong>SECTION 1. ACCESS TO THE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1</strong> Service. We will make the Services and Your Service Data available to You pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Order Form(s) and Documentation in accordance with Your Service Plan. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except (a) during Planned Downtime (of which We will give advance notice via Our Site or to the Account owner); and (b) Force Majeure Events.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> Support. We will, at no additional charge, provide applicable standard customer support for the Services to You as detailed on the applicable Site and Documentation, and upgraded support, if purchased.</p>
<p><strong>1.3</strong> Modifications. You acknowledge that Zendesk may modify the features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. Zendesk shall provide You with commercially reasonable advance notice of any deprecation of any material feature or functionality.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong> Additional Features. We will notify You of applicable Supplemental Terms and/or alternate agreement prior to Your activation of any Additional Features. The activation of any Additional Features by You in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the applicable Supplemental Terms or alternate agreement where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>1.5</strong> Extension of Rights to Affiliates. You may extend Your rights, benefits and protections provided herein to Your Affiliates and to contractors or service providers acting on Your or Your Affiliates’ behalf, provided that You remain responsible for Your and their compliance hereunder.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="use-of-the-services">
<p><strong>SECTION 2. USE OF THE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> Login Management. Access to and use of the Services is restricted to the specified number of individual Agents permitted under Your subscription to the applicable Service. You agree and acknowledge that an Agent Login cannot be shared or used by more than one (1) individual. However, Agent Logins may be reassigned to new individuals replacing former individuals who no longer require ongoing use of the Services. You and Your Agents are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Agent Login information for Your Account. Absent a written license from Zendesk expressly stating otherwise, You agree and acknowledge that You may not use the Services, including but not limited to the API, to circumvent the requirement for an individual Agent Login for each individual who (a) leverages the Services to interact with End-Users; (b) Processes data related to interactions with End-Users; or (c) Processes data related to interactions originating from a Non-Zendesk Service that provides functionality similar to functionality provided by the Services and which would, pursuant to this Agreement, require an individual Agent Login if utilizing the Services for such interaction. Further, Subscriber shall not use the API or any Software in such a way to circumvent applicable Service Plan restrictions or Agent licensing restrictions that are enforced in the Service user interface. Should Zendesk discover that Your use of a Zendesk Service is not in compliance with this Agreement or the Service Plan features and limitations on Our Site, Zendesk reserves the right to charge You, and You hereby agree to pay for said usage in addition to other remedies available to Us.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> Compliance. As between You and Zendesk, You are responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by Agents and End-Users and for any and all activities that occur under Your Account, which Zendesk may verify from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your use of the Services is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations You may maintain or enter into with Agents or End-Users.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong> Content and Conduct. In addition to complying with the other terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, You agree to the Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy available on Zendesk’s Policies and Procedures Website, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. Further, in Your use of the Services You agree not to (a) modify, adapt, or hack the Services or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or related systems or networks; (b) falsely imply any sponsorship or association with Zendesk or the Zendesk Group; (c) use the Services in any unlawful manner, including, but not limited to, violation of any person’s privacy rights; (d) attempt to bypass or break any security or rate limiting mechanism on any of the Services or use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity, security or performance of the Services and its components; (e) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any Software making up the Services; (f) to the extent You are subject to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (HIPAA), use the Services to store or transmit any “protected health information” as defined by HIPAA, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk; (g) use or launch any automated system that accesses a Service (i.e., bot) in a manner that sends more request messages to a Service server in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online web browser; or (h) launch or facilitate, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a denial of service attack on any of the Services or any other conduct that materially and adversely impacts the availability, reliability, or stability of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong> System Requirements. A high-speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Services. You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Your network to the Services, including, but not limited to, browser software that supports protocols used by Zendesk, including the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zendesk, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols. We are not responsible for notifying You, Agents or End-Users of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data, including Service Data, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities (including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Zendesk. We assume no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this Section.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong> Internal Business Purposes Only. Unless otherwise authorized by Zendesk in this Agreement or expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk, You may not use the Services in any manner where You act as a service bureau or to provide any outsourced business process services on behalf of more than one (1) third party (other than Affiliates) through a single Account. Accordingly, You agree not to license, sublicense, sell, outsource, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time-share or otherwise commercially exploit or resell the Services to any third party, other than authorized Agents and End-Users in furtherance of Your internal business purposes as expressly permitted by this Agreement, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk. Without limiting the foregoing, Your right to access and use the API is also subject to the restrictions and policies implemented by Zendesk from time to time with respect to the API as set forth in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to You in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong> No Competitive Access. You may not access the Services if You are a direct competitor of the Zendesk Group, except with Zendesk’s express prior written consent. You may not access the Services for competitive purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="term-cancellation-termination">
<p><strong>SECTION 3. TERM, CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to a Service is terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form (a) Your subscription to a Service (including any and all Deployed Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term and (b) the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the applicable Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services at the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Cancellation. Either Party may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to a Service as of the end of Your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with this Agreement, no less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of such Subscription Term.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Mutual Termination for Cause. A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the breaching Party’s receipt of such written notice; or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p>If this Agreement is terminated by You in accordance with this Section, We will refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Terms of the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>If this Agreement is terminated by Us in accordance with this Section, You will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all applicable Order Forms. In no event will Our termination for cause relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> Payment Upon Termination. Except for Your termination under Section 3.3, if You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term, or if We terminate or cancel Your Account pursuant to Section 3.3, in addition to any other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term.</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> No Refunds. Except for Your termination rights under Section 3.3, if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term, no refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You.</p>
<p><strong>3.6</strong> Export of Service Data. For thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, upon Your request, We will make Service Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation. Thereafter, We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Service Data, and, as provided in the Documentation, We will, unless prohibited by law or legal order, delete Your Service Data in Our Services in accordance with Our Data Deletion Policy available on Zendesk’s Policies and Procedures Website.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="billing-plan-modification-payments">
<p><strong>SECTION 4. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> Payment and Billing. All Subscription Charges are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or, with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, an Order Form, a Statement of Work, or in Supplemental Terms, or as otherwise agreed for Usage Charges. You are responsible for providing valid and current payment information and You agree to promptly update your Account information, including payment information, with any changes that may occur (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date). If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or other charges indicated on any Order Form within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> Upgrades. If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term, any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such upgrade will be charged in accordance with the remaining Subscription Term. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> Downgrades. You may not downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents during Your Subscription Term. If You desire to downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents under any Service Plan for a subsequent Subscription Term, You must provide Zendesk with thirty (30) days advance written notice prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong> Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any Taxes. You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against the Zendesk Group measured by its net income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> Payment Agent. If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Zendesk Service are billed and processed by Zendesk’s Payment Agent. You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services, and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. If applicable, You hereby authorize Zendesk and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish prepaid credit. The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status. To the extent the Payment Agent is not Zendesk, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service. The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong> Payment Portals. If You mandate Zendesk use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal which charges Zendesk a subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required cost of doing business, You shall be invoiced by Zendesk for, and You are obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.</p>
<p><strong>4.7</strong> Promotional Credits. Any promotional credits issued hereunder will be subject to the Zendesk Promotional Credits Policy available on the Zendesk Policies and Procedures Website.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="confidential-information">
<p><strong>SECTION 5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> Each Party will protect the other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each Party protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information (a) solely to the employees and/or non-employee service providers and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by terms of confidentiality intended to prevent the misuse of such Confidential Information; (b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation. The provisions of this Section 5 shall control over any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties and any such non-disclosure agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to the exchange of Confidential Information after the execution of this Agreement. To be clear, any exchange of Confidential Information prior to the execution of this Agreement shall continue to be governed by any such non-disclosure agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="ownership-security-service-data">
<p><strong>SECTION 6. OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY OF SERVICE DATA</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> Ownership of Service Data. Subscriber shall retain ownership rights to all Service Data Processed under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> No Sale of Service Data. Zendesk will never sell, rent, or lease Your Service Data to any third party. We will not share Your Service Data with third parties, except as permitted by this Agreement and in order to provide, secure and support the Services.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> Safeguards. The Zendesk Group will maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Service Data for Enterprise Services in accordance with the Enterprise Security Measures described at <a href="../protect-service-data-enterprise-services/index.html">“How We Protect Your Service Data (Enterprise Services)”</a>; for Innovation Services in accordance with the Innovation Security Measures described at <a href="../protect-service-data-innovation-services/index.html">“How We Protect Your Service Data (Innovation Services)”</a>; as well as in accordance with Supplemental Terms for any Deployed Associated Services, as applicable. The Zendesk Group’s compliance with the Enterprise Security Measures or the Innovation Security Measures, each as applicable, shall be deemed compliance with the Zendesk’s Group’s obligations to protect Service Data as set forth in the Agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="privacy-practices">
<p><strong>SECTION 7. PRIVACY PRACTICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> Subscriber as Data Controller. To the extent Service Data constitutes Personal Data, the Parties agree that You shall be deemed to be the Data Controller, and the relevant entity in the Zendesk Group shall be deemed to be the Data Processor, as those terms are understood under the Applicable Data Protection Law. We explain how We process Service Data in our role as Data Processor in our Privacy and Data Protection website available at: <a href="../../privacy-and-data-protection/index.html">https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy-and-data-protection/</a> and in our Data Processing Agreement (see Section 7.4 below).</p>
<p><strong>7.2</strong> Hosting and Processing. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Zendesk, Service Data may be hosted by the Zendesk Group, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the EEA or other locations around the world. In providing the Services, Zendesk will engage entities within the Zendesk Group and other authorized service providers to Process Service Data, including and without limitation, any Personal Data within Service Data pursuant to this Agreement within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories.</p>
<p><strong>7.3</strong> Transfer of Personal Data. To the extent that Personal Data within Service Data originates from an Agent or End-User in the EEA, as further described in our DPA, We will ensure that, pursuant to Applicable Data Protection Law, if Personal Data within Service Data is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), then such transfer will only take place if: (a) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection; (b) one of the conditions listed in Article 46 GDPR (or its equivalent under any successor legislation) is satisfied; (c) the Personal Data is transferred on the basis of Zendesk’s approved binding corporate rules known as the Zendesk Binding Corporate Rules available on Zendesk’s Privacy and Data Protection Website, which establish adequate protection of such personal information and are legally binding on the Zendesk Group; or (d) the transfer takes place pursuant to the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. We will further ensure that the transfer is subject to the standard contractual clauses designed to facilitate transfers of Personal Data from the EEA to all third countries that have been adopted by the European Commission, which have been incorporated into the DPA.</p>

</div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="consulting-services">
<p class="center"><strong>EXHIBIT B<br /> SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS: CONSULTING SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>If Subscriber has engaged Zendesk for the provision of professional services (including any training, success, and implementation services) (collectively, “Consulting Services”) as indicated on a Statement of Work (“SOW”) or other written document such as a “Description of Consulting Services” on an Order Form, the provision of such Consulting Services will be governed by the Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to in a SOW or Order Form, Subscriber agrees that any Consulting Services purchased by Subscriber must commence within six (6) months of the execution of the SOW or Order Form. In consideration of the foregoing, Subscriber and Zendesk, intending to be legally bound, agree to the terms set forth below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Scope.</strong> All Consulting Services provided by Zendesk to Subscriber and all deliverables required to be provided by Zendesk to Subscriber pursuant to the Agreement (“Deliverables”) will be outlined in one or more mutually agreed-upon and jointly executed SOWs or Order Forms, each incorporated into the Agreement and describing in detail the scope, nature and other relevant characteristics of the Consulting Services and Deliverables to be provided.</p>
<p><strong>2. Retention. </strong> Subscriber hereby retains Zendesk to provide the Consulting Services described in one or more SOWs or Order Forms, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement. Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any Consulting Services until both Parties have mutually agreed upon and executed a SOW or Order Form with respect to such Consulting Services. After execution of a SOW or Order Form, the Consulting Services to be provided under that SOW or Order Form may only be changed through a change order mutually executed by the Parties (“Change Order”).</p>
<p><strong>3. Performance of Consulting Services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> Each SOW or Order Form will include reasonable details about Consulting Services, including, at a minimum, the Consulting Fees (defined below). Zendesk and Subscriber agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Consulting Services in a timely and professional manner.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Zendesk will perform the Consulting Services through qualified employees and/or non-employee contractors of Zendesk (“Subcontractors” and together with Zendesk’s employees for the purposes of these Supplemental Terms, “Consulting Services Personnel”). Subscriber agrees to provide, at no cost to Zendesk, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Zendesk to enable the performance of the Consulting Services (collectively, “Assistance”). Zendesk, including its Subcontractors, will not be liable for any deficiency in the performance of Consulting Services to the extent such deficiency results from any acts or omissions of Subscriber, including, but not limited to, Subscriber’s failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> In performing the Consulting Services, Zendesk will utilize Consulting Services Personnel as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof. Subscriber may object to Zendesk’s use of a Subcontractor by specifying its reasonable objection to Zendesk, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Consulting Services Personnel to perform such Consulting Services. Zendesk may replace Consulting Services Personnel in its normal course of business, provided that Zendesk will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Consulting Services Personnel.</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> Zendesk will control the method and manner of performing all work necessary for completion of Consulting Services, including but not limited to the supervision and control of any Consulting Services Personnel performing Consulting Services. Zendesk will maintain such number of qualified Consulting Services Personnel and appropriate facilities and other resources sufficient to perform Zendesk’s obligations under the Agreement in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p><strong>3.6</strong> Consulting Services Personnel may enter (“assume into”) Subscriber’s production Account to provide the Consulting Services as provided for in Zendesk’s Customer Controlled User Assumption Policy found at: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/%20115001753608-Granting-Zendesk-temporary-access-to-your-account.</p>
<p><strong>3.7</strong> In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW or Order Form (including, but not limited to, any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW or Order Form), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk. If Zendesk elects to perform such changes to the Consulting Services, the Parties shall work together in good faith to execute a written Change Order. Zendesk shall be entitled to an adjustment in Consulting Fees pursuant to the changes reflected in the Change Order. Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any differing or additional Consulting Services unless the Parties have mutually agreed upon a written Change Order.</p>
<p><strong>3.8</strong> Unless otherwise agreed to in a SOW or Order Form, for Consulting Services that are Deliverable or milestone based, upon delivery of all Deliverables or completion of all milestones detailed in the SOW or Order Form, Zendesk shall provide Subscriber with written notice (“Completion Notice”). Thereafter, Subscriber shall have five (5) business days from the date of the Completion Notice to provide Zendesk with written notice describing any Deliverables that have not been provided or milestones not met. The SOW or Order Form shall be deemed complete and the Deliverables accepted or milestones met absent Subscriber’s timely written notice of any Deliverables not having been provided or milestones not having been met. In the event that Subscriber provides timely written notice of any Deliverables not having been provided or milestones not having been met, Zendesk shall make commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the defects identified. If the defects cannot be remedied, Subscriber may terminate the applicable SOW and Zendesk shall return the portion of the Consulting Fees paid to Zendesk by Subscriber for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services (or, if Consulting Fees have not yet been paid, Subscriber will be relieved from its obligation to pay Consulting Fees for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services). For the avoidance of doubt, a Completion Notice shall not be necessary for Consulting Services that are time and materials based.</p>
<p><strong>4. Consulting Fees.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> Subscriber will pay Zendesk the fees to provide the Consulting Services as detailed or described in an Order Form or SOW (the “Consulting Fees”).</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> All Consulting Services will be provided on either a time and materials or fixed-fee basis, as indicated in the applicable SOW or Order Form. Each SOW or Order Form providing for time and materials based Consulting Fees will contain a detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (“T&amp;M Estimate”). Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&amp;M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties. If it appears that the T&amp;M Estimate may be exceeded, Zendesk will make a reasonable effort to notify Subscriber as soon as practicable and provide an amended T&amp;M Estimate. Upon receiving such amended T&amp;M Estimate, Subscriber will accept or reject the amended T&amp;M Estimate. Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T&amp;M Estimate within five (5) business days of delivery, such amended T&amp;M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Consulting Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&amp;M Estimate. Any amended T&amp;M Estimate which is accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> As detailed in the applicable SOW or Order Form, the performance of Consulting Services may be subject to an advance payment of Consulting Fees by Subscriber upon execution of the SOW or Order Form. Such retainer will be applied against Consulting Fees which become payable by Subscriber. Zendesk may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such advance payment is paid to Zendesk.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong> In addition to any and all Consulting Fees, Subscriber will reimburse Zendesk for any reasonable expenses for travel, lodging, communications, shipping charges and out-of-pocket expenses, including changes to travel and accommodations resulting from Subscriber’s request incurred by Zendesk in connection with providing the Consulting Services (“Expenses”). Zendesk will provide reasonable documentation for all Expenses as requested by Subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> Any unpaid Consulting Fees or Expenses will become overdue thirty (30) days after payment is due and shall be subject to a late fee of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month for each month where payment is not received.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong> Cancellation/Changes: Any cancellations of or changes to the Consulting Services less than five (5) business days prior to the agreed upon Consulting Services commencement date are subject to forfeiture of Consulting Fees paid and reserved date(s).</p>
<p><strong>5. Relationship of the Parties.</strong> Zendesk is an independent contractor and will maintain complete control of and responsibility for its Consulting Services Personnel, methods and operations in providing Consulting Services. Zendesk will never hold itself out as an agent, subsidiary or affiliate of Subscriber for any purpose, including reporting to any government authority. The Agreement will not be construed so as to create a partnership, other joint venture or undertaking, or any agency relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall become liable for any representation, act or omission of the other Party or have the authority to contractually bind the other Party. Any Consulting Fees, Expenses or other amounts paid by Subscriber to Zendesk hereunder shall not be considered salary for pension or wage tax purposes and neither Zendesk nor its Consulting Services Personnel will be entitled to any fringe benefits, including sick or vacation pay, or other supplemental benefits of Subscriber, unless otherwise required by law. Subscriber shall not be responsible for deducting or withholding from Consulting Fees or Expenses paid for Consulting Services any taxes, unemployment, social security or other such expense unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p><strong>6. Warranties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> Zendesk hereby represents and warrants that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the Consulting Services provided pursuant to the Agreement will be performed in a timely and professional manner by Zendesk and its Consulting Services Personnel, consistent with generally-accepted industry standards; provided that Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty will be, at Zendesk’s option, re-performance of the Consulting Services or termination of the applicable SOW and return of the portion of the Consulting Fees paid to Zendesk by Subscriber for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services; and</li>
<li>it is under no contractual or other restrictions or obligations which are inconsistent with the execution of the Agreement, or, to its best knowledge, which will interfere with its performance of the Consulting Services.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> The Parties hereby agree that:</p>
<p> EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.1 ABOVE, ALL CONSULTING SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES ARE PROVIDED TO SUBSCRIBER “AS IS” AND ZENDESK MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS TO SUBSCRIBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION, OPERATION OR FITNESS THEREOF AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING CONSULTING SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATIBILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY. ZENDESK SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, IN LAW OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY DELIVERABLES DESPITE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, IN THE EVENT THAT SUBSCRIBER MODIFIES ANY DELIVERABLES IN A MANNER NOT INSTRUCTED BY ZENDESK. ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SUBSCRIBER’S OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE DELIVERABLES SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY. FURTHER, ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT OR MAINTAIN ANY DELIVERABLE AND WILL NOT DO SO UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY IS EXPRESSLY MADE IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMERS MADE BY ZENDESK OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER THE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AS APPLICABLE TO SUBSCRIBER AND ANY THIRD PARTY’S USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
<p><strong>7. Rights to Deliverables; Ownership.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> The Parties hereby agree that the specified Consulting Services to be completed pursuant to any SOW or Order Form primarily involve the configuration of Subscriber’s subscription to a Service and integration of Subscriber data with and into one or more Services, and therefore the Deliverables are inoperative without an active subscription to a Service. As between the Parties, Zendesk shall solely and exclusively own all right, title, and interest in the Deliverables (other than Assigned Deliverables, as defined below), including all derivatives, enhancements and modifications thereof; and Subscriber hereby makes all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Zendesk grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Deliverables (other than Assigned Deliverables) solely in connection with Subscriber’s permitted use of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>7.2</strong> An “Assigned Deliverable” is a Deliverable created by Zendesk in connection with the Consulting Services that is specifically identified as being assigned to Subscriber in an SOW, excluding any Zendesk Background IP that may be incorporated into such Deliverable. “Zendesk Background IP” means inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information, tools and other intellectual property owned by Zendesk that are incorporated into an Assigned Deliverable and, (a) in existence prior to the commencement of the Consulting Services or (b) developed, created, conceived or reduced to practice by Zendesk not in connection with the applicable SOW. Subject to payment of the applicable Consulting Fees for the applicable Assigned Deliverable, (i) Zendesk hereby assigns title to such Assigned Deliverable to Subscriber, and (ii) to the extent any Zendesk Background IP is incorporated into such Assigned Deliverable, Zendesk grants to Subscriber a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to use and exercise such Zendesk Background IP in connection with such Assigned Deliverable.</p>
<p><strong>7.3</strong> A “Subscriber Contribution” is source code that is created by Subscriber in connection with the Consulting Services and is specifically identified in a SOW. Subscriber and Zendesk agree that Subscriber retains title to Subscriber Contributions, and Subscriber hereby grants Zendesk a non-exclusive license to use and exercise the Subscriber Contributions for the performance of the Consulting Services and Services.</p>
<p><strong>8. Open Source.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.1</strong> Zendesk may incorporate open source materials into any Deliverable or Assigned Deliverable. Zendesk will notify Subscriber that it is providing such open source software upon or prior to delivery, and Zendesk will avoid providing any open source materials that are governed by a so-called “copyleft license” that would require Subscriber to permit any disclosure of, distribute or make available any of Subscriber’s proprietary software if Subscriber uses the Deliverables or Assigned Deliverables as permitted hereunder. Any open source materials provided by Zendesk are licensed to Subscriber pursuant to the terms of the applicable open source license and not this Agreement.</p>
