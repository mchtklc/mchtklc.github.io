				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been to a clothing store where an employee makes some seriously left-field suggestions for your wardrobe?</p>
<p>Confused. Tired. Frustrated. These are just a few emotions that pop up while you sit tight, hoping they&rsquo;ll pull the perfect T-shirt you&rsquo;re looking for. As it turns out, the employee only pushes products that the brand is simply trying to sell without any regard for your personal style.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t get it because they don&rsquo;t know you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in this type of scenario, you&rsquo;re not alone. In fact, 71% of consumers have voiced some type of displeasure when their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://grow.segment.com/Segment-2017-Personalization-Report.pdf">shopping experience was too impersonal</a>.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    71% of consumers have voiced displeasure when their shopping experience was too impersonal.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That feeling is only amplified when consumers interact with large companies worth millions and even billions of dollars. Since they&rsquo;re already massive and making so much money, customers often think they&rsquo;re not an individual priority for enterprise companies.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. As an enterprise company, you still have the ability to make every single customer feel special. To avoid alienating them, it&rsquo;s important to provide personalized service that always addresses individual consumer needs.</p>
<h2>What is personalized service?</h2>
<p>Personalized service refers to a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/enterprise/personalized-support-at-scale/">customized approach to the customer experience</a>. It&rsquo;s all about taking individual customer needs into consideration.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what personalized service should look like, you don&rsquo;t need to look any further than your email inbox. Go ahead and take a quick look at a few emails you&rsquo;ve received from different companies. Notice anything interesting?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, there&rsquo;s a good chance you have some emails from companies that address you by your name and include information you&rsquo;re personally interested in. Then there&rsquo;s spam, the emails that are generic sales pitches masked as emails.</p>
<p>So, which type of email do you think gets a better customer response?</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    Based on email subject lines alone, personalization can boost open rates by 26%.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ding ding! You guessed it. Based on email subject lines alone, personalization can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/">boost open rates</a> by 26%. That means something as simple as greeting a person using their first name versus a &ldquo;hi there!&rdquo; opening. The former makes it feel like the company is addressing you directly, while the latter is like getting a car dealership grand opening letter in your mailbox.</p>
<p>The power of personalization isn&rsquo;t limited to email, either. Personalized service is also something companies are keeping a closer eye on these days. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/8-top-findings-in-gartner-cmo-spend-survey-2018-19">Personalization efforts</a> account for 14.2% of an average CMO&rsquo;s budget. There has been an increased focus on personalized service in recent years, and enterprise companies are starting to take notice.</p>
<h2>Why should enterprise companies offer personalized service?</h2>
<p>At large companies with sprawling <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/grow-customer-base/">customer bases</a>, consumers often feel like they&rsquo;re just another number on the board. Nobody thinks the Nike store values you more as a customer than a locally owned sneaker shop &mdash; even though that might be true. The general perception is that enterprise companies don&rsquo;t have time for the little guy.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some outliers, people often view enterprise companies as faceless organizations that don&rsquo;t care about them. Personalized service can help you change that narrative and provide great individual support to each customer. It can even make you stand out among competitors that aren&rsquo;t offering that type of support.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    44% of consumers who have been satisfied with the personalized service they&rsquo;ve received will become repeat customers.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-retention/">Customer retention</a> is another major benefit of offering personalized service. Segment&rsquo;s <em>2017 State of Personalization Report</em> found that 44% of consumers who have been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://grow.segment.com/Segment-2017-Personalization-Report.pdf">satisfied with the personalized service they&rsquo;ve received will become repeat customers</a>. This can help drive <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/building-customer-loyalty/">customer loyalty</a> with customers championing your product or service.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let those loyal customers just come in and out of your life, either. Give them a reason to stick around. With <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/loyalty-rewards/">loyalty programs</a>, enterprise companies can reward customers for making multiple purchases and sending referrals &mdash; two factors that boost <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.alexa.com/building-brand-affinity/">brand affinity</a>.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easier than ever. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-guide/">CRM</a> software has made sure of that. With seamless access to a vast array of customer data, enterprise companies are able to use CRM software to get a better understanding of consumer buying habits and personalize the customer experience for them.</p>
<p>With all the tools and tech available to enterprise companies today, there&rsquo;s really no excuse for not offering personalized service.</p>
<h2>What information do you need to provide personalized service?</h2>
<p>If you want to offer the best personalized service, you need to have the best customer data. Without it, you won&rsquo;t be able to discern any customer insights at the individual level and offering a great customer experience will become a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Customer identification</h3>
<p>Not to get all Shakespearean on you, but what&rsquo;s in a name? For enterprise companies, names are gateways into delivering personalized service. If you address a customer by name, they go from being just another number to a real living, breathing person with their own personal preferences.</p>
<p>Companies ask for your name in forms, so they can start building a personal connection with you. It&rsquo;s the very first step in establishing a personal connection that your entire personalized service towards them will be built upon.</p>
<p>So, as an enterprise company, always ask customers for their name. Whether that&rsquo;s in the form of offering gated content or a compelling weekly email newsletter, offering some type of value in exchange for identification is also a great way to entice customers.</p>
<h3>Customer history</h3>
<p>Customer history is one of the most important pieces of the personalized service puzzle. This gives you immediate context into how a customer has engaged with your company. It&rsquo;s like a relationship timeline.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    Enterprise companies need to have insight into each and every one of their customers.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Despite having so many customers, enterprise companies need to have insight into each and every one of them. They need to know what products and services their customers bought. They need to know which <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/enterprise-customer-service/">service</a> reps customers talk to. They need to know how long a person has been a customer.</p>
<p>For enterprise companies, automating this process is a must. Using a CRM software, you can instantly pull customer history insights.</p>
<p>Zendesk Support&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/customer-context/">Customer Context</a> feature can help you quickly pull up your customer&rsquo;s name, location, purchase history, and detailed insight into their unique customer journey.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk’s Customer Context feature" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/customer-context.png" /></p>
<h3>Device information</h3>
<p>Convenience is critical when it comes to customer support. You need to find out what device your customers primarily use and the best way to connect with them on that device.</p>
<p>While younger consumers generally lean towards smartphones to make purchases, older consumers might be more inclined to buy things on their laptop or tablet. It&rsquo;s on you to find out what their preferences are.</p>
<p>With that in mind, always optimize your personalized service for different devices. If you have a great signup form or email newsletter for desktop, that should also be the case for mobile. You need to have the same user experience and quality on every device your company is represented on.</p>
<h3>Languages and cultural expectations</h3>
<p>Enterprise companies often have a wide customer base that spans the entire globe, which means you can&rsquo;t communicate with every customer in the same way.</p>
<p>Making sure your customer service is available in different languages is important. Don&rsquo;t assume everyone can read your company&rsquo;s native language. From your website to direct conversations customer service reps have with customers, everything needs to be customized by language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to understand cultural differences when dealing with customers. Someone from the United States will likely have a different outlook on customer service than someone from India, for example. Making sure your customer service is personalized for every country your company has a presence in is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the time difference. Zendesk&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-introduces-multiple-schedules/">Multiple Schedules</a> feature makes it easy to display worldwide operating hours to customers. This feature can also leave personalized messages for customers about when they&rsquo;ll likely get a response if they try to reach out to support after hours.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk’s Multiple Schedules feature" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/multiple-schedules.png" /></p>
<h3>Location and environmental context</h3>
<p>Enterprise companies usually have a lot of different locations. Getting intel on a customer&rsquo;s location can help you deliver better offers to them faster. You can give them a discount code that they can redeem at a nearby store, for example.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if they&rsquo;re out in the boonies, offering free shipping and/or an online discount code can be useful if you offer online shopping. These customers might not have immediate access to a nearby store, but they can be just as willing to shop and spend money online.</p>
<h2>Start personalizing your customer experience</h2>
<p>Personalized service at the enterprise level isn&rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, as technology continues to open up new ways to innovate the customer experience, enterprise companies are going to be investing more money into it.</p>
<p>The key is to always be in stride with your customers. You&rsquo;re not creating the most convenient personalized service experience based on your preferences as a company. You&rsquo;re creating it with your customers&rsquo; individual needs in mind.</p>
<p>Building a strategy to deliver personalized service now can set your enterprise company up for success later on. If you want to learn more about how to deliver a truly exceptional customer experience, the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2020</a> has all the juicy customer insights you need.</p>

<p>You see it in office lunch rooms, middle school dance floors and on social media: we, as humans, love belonging to groups.</p>
<p>A group is a collection of people with something in common&mdash;maybe a geographic location, a career, or a hobby. If you&rsquo;re looking to resonate with all members of a group, the best approach is to work off of their commonalities.</p>
<p>The same theory goes for understanding customers: the best way to connect with them is to group them by shared characteristics.</p>
<p>This is especially important for support. Your customers are coming to you for help solving a problem, and they expect you to &#8220;get it.&#8221; The better you understand your group, the better you can find solutions just for them.</p>
<p>The business term for sorting customers by shared traits is customer segmentation. It gives you all the info you need to provide a tailored support experience.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>

<h2>What is customer segmentation?</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Customer segmentation is a way of grouping customers together based on their similarities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Segmentation is putting the customer base into meaningful buckets to differentiate support experiences,&rdquo; says Benjamin Collet, Senior Director of Enterprise Global Advocacy for Zendesk.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you can segment your customers, depending on your team&rsquo;s goals. You can organize by behavior, like buying habits, or by demographic, like age or location. No matter how you organize your customers, segmenting gives you a fast pass to solving their needs.</p>
</p></div>

<h2>Why use customer segmentation for support?</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<p>Customer segmentation lets you personalize your support experiences so customers feel understood, which leads to increased satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treating customers differently based on their needs is one of the most important ways to have a meaningful relationship that builds growth and loyalty,&rdquo; Collet says.</p>
<div class="accordion js-accordion">
<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-closed">
<h3>You can offer hyper-relevant support</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Different customer segments require different solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine offering a small business customer the solutions you have available for enterprise customers,&rdquo; Collet says. &ldquo;It would be overwhelming to hear about creating your own integrations with developers you don&rsquo;t have, and professional services you can&rsquo;t afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the flip side, if your support were set up only for small businesses, it would cause big problems for enterprise customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the only way to get help as an enterprise customer was through self-service? Time is ticking down for your deadlines, and you have production-impacting needs demanding urgent and customized subject-matter expertise,&rdquo; Collet says.</p>
<p>Segmentation fixes that. Grouping your customers by how complex their businesses are gives the agent a guideline to follow when offering support solutions. If it&rsquo;s a small business, the agent will focus on quick, simple solutions the caller can handle on their own. If it&rsquo;s a large enterprise, the agent will be prepared to escalate the support request for a faster, more thorough fix.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-closed">
<h3>Agents can provide a faster experience</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Segmentation streamlines the support experience, so agents can provide answers faster.</p>
<p>When a segmented customer makes contact, the agent already has information to start helping. The support platform can take details from the customer&rsquo;s initial query and compare it with issues seen by other customers in this segment to give the agent solutions from similar issues. Not having to look up customer info to understand the customer&rsquo;s problem saves agents valuable time.</p>
<p>Knowing what to expect also helps with connecting the customer to the right agent the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst customer experience to be told, &lsquo;Oh, sorry, for that question I need to get you to another team,&rsquo;&rdquo; Collet says.</p>
<p>Zendesk minimizes multiple connections by lining up agents with customers based on their segment traits. Agents focused on one product line or customer group are familiar with most common issues. That expertise means they can answer customers&rsquo; questions faster and more thoroughly.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h5>Customer segmentation example: Answering similar questions</h5>
<p>Most small businesses have similar questions when getting started with a new product. Agents who specialize in small-business onboarding issues are likely to see the same questions come up time and again. If the agent were a generalist, they may still have to pull from resources to get the customer a solution. But reps that focus just on small businesses in the early-stage life-cycle segment will have answered the same question many times and can get to the solution faster than a generalist could.</p>
</p></div>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging customer segmentation, we were able to shape more narrow bandwidth engagements that led to positive agent and customer outcomes,&#8221; Collet says.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-item">

<h3>Segmentation metrics help you see underlying issues</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;re noticing a drop in customer satisfaction scores. You filter the metric by life-cycle stage and can see that customer satisfaction rates are especially low with long-term customers. From there, you can brainstorm retention strategies.</p>
<p>You can also compare your segments to make sure that the issue you&rsquo;re investigating doesn&rsquo;t cross groups. What if customer satisfaction is low across all life-cycle stages? That tells you it&rsquo;s likely that there are fundamental issues at play rather than segment-specific problems driving the trend.</p>

<h2>3 types of customer segmentation</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Customer segmentation is not something you can do in a one-size-fits-all way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a universal segmentation prescription that is equally meaningful for all businesses,&rdquo; Collet says. &ldquo;You have to look at the data and see what segmentation model makes sense for customers, agents, and the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not sure how to organize your customers? Many businesses sort their base by demographic, value, or life-cycle stage.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">By demographic</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Demographic segmentation means splitting customers by gender, age, income, education, or geographic location.</p>
<p>Marketing teams often use demographic segmentation. They&#8217;ll personalize their messaging for a particular age group or to resonate with a certain region.</p>
<p>Demographic segmentation can also make sense for support teams.</p>
<p>Age segmentation can give your agents a heads-up on communication preferences. Younger customers will likely prefer chat or social media support, while older generations will appreciate an email or a phone call.</p>
<p>Age segmentation can also give your reps a hint on tone when communicating. If you&#8217;re working with a Gen Z customer on social media, break out the emojis. If you&#8217;re handling a baby boomer over email, you&#8217;ll get further with full sentences and a respectful tone.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h5>Customer segmentation example: Segmenting for unique times</h5>
<p>In times of natural disaster, you might decide to segment by region to offer specialized support. With this segmentation, agents are able to quickly reach out to affected groups and provide extra help if needed.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<hr />
    </div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">By value or cost</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Segment customers based on the economic value they provide to your business. This helps you allocate support resources where they&rsquo;re most needed.</p>
<p>If a customer isn&rsquo;t generating a lot of revenue, you may want to rethink the level of support you&rsquo;re offering them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say a small business is calling your support team two or three times a month,&rdquo; Collet says. &ldquo;Maybe you know the cost per unit for a phone call is $45. And those small businesses only pay $15 for the product. You might want to take a closer look at phones as an unlimited channel for that customer segment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collet warns that the best approach isn&#8217;t necessarily cutting down on those services. Instead, try to find cost-saving alternatives.</p>
<p>Using these alternative solutions for lower-revenue-generating customers empowers your agents to help higher-value enterprise customers more. These customers are far more likely to have complicated support issues that a forum or bot can&rsquo;t solve.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h5>Customer segmentation example: Decluttering your phone queue</h5>
<p>Look at the questions commonly asked on phone calls, and see whether there&#8217;s a way of answering them off the phone. You may find that you can make a product improvement that makes the question unnecessary or offer the answer in a FAQs page or community forum.</p>
</p></div>

<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">By life-cycle stage</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Segmenting by life-cycle stage is grouping customers by where they&rsquo;re at in their customer journey. This segmentation highlights how customers&rsquo; support needs change as they move through the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of having basic questions on how to use your product, veteran users&rsquo; questions will become about how to maximize the product&rsquo;s efficiency. As their business grows in complexity over time, their support needs are likely to grow in complexity as well,&rdquo; Collet says.</p>
<p>Customers expect their support team to evolve with them to meet their changing business needs. It&rsquo;s especially important with long-term B2B customers. These businesses are likely to continue to grow in complexity, and B2B customers rely heavily on support to help their businesses continue to expand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a customer, as my business succeeds and my needs grow in complexity and urgency, Zendesk support treatments grow with me,&rdquo; Collet says. &ldquo;This is an important element of trust&mdash;that across my life cycle as a customer, I will always have a partner who is in lockstep with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h5>Customer segmentation example: Customers in onboarding</h5>
<p>Customers often need a lot of support during the onboarding process. In this stage, they&rsquo;re getting used to using your product and likely experience issues on a regular basis. As they transition out of onboarding into retention, their support needs will change.</p>

<h2>Steps to building a customer segmentation strategy</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<p>Your customer segmentation strategy is your road map to how and why you&rsquo;re organizing your customers the way you are. Your strategy should give you clarity on why you&#8217;re using segmentation and which model you&#8217;re choosing.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">Step 1: know your goals in advance</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Before you start organizing your customer groups, think about how your segmentation is serving the bigger picture&mdash;your business and your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Start with identifying your company-wide goals.</strong> Reviewing these objectives will help you figure out which segments best complement the company&rsquo;s larger <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-segmentation-analytics/">customer experience</a> strategy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the company strategy is to focus on cost efficiency, it may make sense to focus a segment on self-service and bot-powered experiences,&rdquo; Collet says.</p>
<p><strong>Consider your customers&rsquo; goals.</strong> Maybe customers report that onboarding takes too long. You might use segmentation to allocate more agents to early-stage customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asking, &lsquo;How can I best divide up segments to maximize quality of support in alignment with customer needs?&rsquo; is a primary way of creating a segmentation strategy,&#8221; Collet says.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<hr />
    </div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">Step 2: Determine the best way to segment your customers</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>With these goals in mind, you need to decide which model of segmentation makes the most sense for your customer groups.</p>
<p><strong>Start with segments that already exist in your company. </strong>If other departments are using customer segmentation, try out their models first. If all the teams in your business are segmenting the same way, you&rsquo;ll have a common framework for discussing customer needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your sales team or success team is using a segment strategy, try on those definitions for yourself,&rdquo; Collet advises. &ldquo;You might be surprised at how meaningful they are to you. It may power up your partnerships with those teams so you can build support treatments in concert.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>If other team segments don&rsquo;t work for support, create your own support-specific segments that closely align with your goals.</strong></p>
<p>Say your support team isn&rsquo;t scaling solutions well based on customer business size. Try segmenting by company size to offer more tailored treatment.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have a customer base that differs a lot in age. Segmenting by demographic would let you relate to each age group in the way they prefer. And having a unique contact strategy for each age demographic should improve your customer satisfaction ratings.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<hr />
    </div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3 class="accent-underline">Step 3: Revisit your strategy regularly and adjust your service as needed</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Be prepared to make changes in your segmentation strategy if what you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>The whole point of segmentation is to relate in a personalized way to your customers. Providing a tailored experience should streamline your problem-solving process and increase customer satisfaction. The goal should be agents who understand your customers better and are able to reach solutions faster. If this isn&rsquo;t happening, you&rsquo;ve probably segmented your customers by the wrong factors.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to choose the right segments the first time around. It might take some time to find the right groupings; don&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h5>Customer segmentation example: Satisfaction scores aren&rsquo;t improving</h5>
<p>If satisfaction scores aren&rsquo;t improving for a particular segment after personalizing your approach, you might have to change your methods. Maybe you chose the wrong solution, like deciding an older age segment would love to connect with you on social media.</p>
<p>Be prepared to tweak the personalized experience you develop for each segment until you find something that resonates with your customer base.</p>

<p>When it comes to growing your business, your salesforce represents the tip of the spear. And sales managers&mdash;well, they&rsquo;re the folks making sure the spears are all sharp and pointing in the same direction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to sales management, you&rsquo;ll likely feel a lot more comfortable pointing your team in the right direction once you understand everything the role entails, how it fits into an organization, and what you can do to make it all feel a bit less challenging.</p>

<h2>What is sales management?</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p><strong>Sales management</strong> is the art of supervising sales representatives and guiding sales processes designed to close more deals.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;sales management&rdquo; actually sells the job short. Most sales managers are in charge of managing at least three separate components&#8230;</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3>People</h3>
<p>Hiring, training, coaching, and regularly monitoring and helping your sales reps.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3>Processes</h3>
<p>Building and maintaining a standardized sales process with clear steps and objectives your reps can follow.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h3>Sales</h3>
<p>Overseeing opportunities and shepherding them from prospecting to close; analyzing wins and losses to pull insights and conduct forecasting.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Of course, all three aspects are connected. Setting standardized sales processes helps you manage a unified and productive team that&rsquo;s able to close more sales. It&rsquo;s critical that you stay invested in each component of sales management without losing sight of the overarching goal.</p>

<h2>Why is sales management important?</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Sales managers are instrumental in getting all of their reps aligned on a common sales process. Managers can implement specific <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-methodology/">sales methodologies</a>, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.troops.ai/blog/meddic-vs-meddpic-vs-meddpicc">MEDDIC and MEDDPIC</a>, which give reps a shared framework for understanding and gauging opportunities. They can also spearhead certain sales management strategies, such as the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-agile-sales-management/">agile methodology</a>, to make their team more efficient at converting sales.</p>
<p>Aside from revenue growth, sales managers serve a critical role in the hierarchy of an organization. Most act as a bridge between their reps and the company&rsquo;s higher-ups, such as directors and executives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a messenger role that goes both ways. Sales managers can rally reps behind leadership&rsquo;s objectives and initiatives, from new revenue goals to product launches. They can also take all of the customer feedback that reps receive and pass that perspective on to leadership.</p>
<p>Sales managers also help create more sales managers. Most start out as reps, receive mentorship from a sales manager, and eventually level up. Once a rep becomes a manager, they can offer the same guidance to their team members.</p>

<h2>What are the core responsibilities of sales team management?</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Sales managers are expected to empower their reps in a variety of ways. Keeping a team focused and on task is a big part of the day-to-day. At the same time, managers need to nurture reps at each stage of their development, from fresh-faced new hires to aspiring sales managers themselves.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Getting new reps familiar with their own roles and responsibilities is a huge part of sales management. The onboarding process should include information about your products and customers, the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/build-sales-crm-process/">sales process</a> your team follows, and the technologies they use.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-2"></div>
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Coaching</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just newbies that can benefit from your experience and advice. You should be able to help all sales reps improve their performance. Provide regular feedback, mentoring, and tutorials on new processes and tech.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Make sure everyone&rsquo;s doing their job&mdash;and doing it well. Track the performance of your reps by looking at key metrics that indicate success and show they&rsquo;re adhering to your sales process.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-2"></div>
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Motivating</h3>
<p>As you probably know, sales can be a dispiriting line of work. Rejection is a common experience. Encourage your reps to be focused, productive, and able to bounce back after disappointments.</p>
<p>Salespeople are often competitive by nature, so friendly sales contests can often keep reps engaged. Just be sure to keep them fun and not stressful (no &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbp3ozjl-qM">second place is a set of steak knives</a>&rdquo;).</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Goal setting</h3>
<p>Part of managing is getting everyone pulling on the same side of the rope. Hammer home your team&rsquo;s common objectives, and regularly check to see how reps are making progress toward them. Make sure your team is targeting broader company-wide goals, as well.</p>
<p>The more you manage, the better sense you&rsquo;ll get of your team&rsquo;s capabilities. Work with leadership to establish or adjust realistic sales goals for your reps.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-2"></div>
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>Communicating</h3>
<p>As a sales manager, you&rsquo;re a critical source of information for a lot of people in your organization. You need to keep your reps aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the company. You also need to keep leadership informed about your team&rsquo;s status, concerns, and ideas.</p>
<p>Facilitate an open and collaborative work environment by keeping your reps in conversation with one another. Solicit input from everyone during sales meetings and lead productive, engaging avenues of discussion.</p>

<h2>What sales management tools do you need?</h2>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>After learning everything involved in sales management, you may be even more intimidated than before. How are you expected to keep track of all your sales reps and the countless opportunities they&rsquo;re targeting?</p>
<p>The good news is you don&rsquo;t have to do it empty-handed. You can use a client relationship management (CRM) system to track all of your company&rsquo;s leads and customers and all of your sales reps&rsquo; interactions with them.</p>
<p>A CRM like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/features/#features">Zendesk Sell</a> makes it easier to see how your reps are doing. The <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041031854">Rep Performance Dashboard</a> shows their total sales, average deal size, number of deals won, quota attainment, pipeline conversion rates, and loss reasons.</p>
<p>      <img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Rep performance dashboard in Zendesk Sell" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/rep-performance-dashboard.png" /></p>
<p>Sell lets you build out <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/using-crm-sales-pipeline-management/">sales pipelines</a> and allows managers to prompt their team to complete tasks at any stage of the pipeline. And if you see that a key piece of information about a prospect is missing, you can nudge the rep in Sell and remind them to get that info on their next sales call.</p>
<p>On a more macro level, Sell documents your deal success rate, helping you gauge the effectiveness of your chosen sales methods. Sales managers may want to experiment with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-methodology/">different sales processes</a> and use their CRM to measure the results to determine which works best.</p>
<p align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell">Learn more about Zendesk Sell</a></p>
<p>Your CRM can also serve as a platform for other tools that make life easier for you and your reps.</p>
<p>Sell integrates with lots of additional sales software tools that make work faster and more efficient. The <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/sell/google-for-sell/">Google Calendar integration</a>, for example, lets you connect Google Calendar, Google Contacts, and Google Tasks to Sell. The two-way sync of all meetings, contact info, and to-do lists with your CRM makes it easier to keep track of important events and information.</p>
<p>      <img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk Sell and Google Calendar integration" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/sell-google-calendar.png" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/sell/zapier-for-sell/">Zapier integration</a> allows you to automate tasks with &ldquo;Zaps&rdquo; that trigger specific actions whenever certain events occur.</p>
<p>For example, you can automate Slack notifications whenever a deal is won or lost, keeping you up-to-date on what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>      <img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zapier and Zendesk Sell integration" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/sell-zapier-triggers.png" /></p>
<p>Zapier also enables you to connect over <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://zapier.com/apps/zendesk-sell/integrations#page=1">2,000 other apps</a> to Sell, from Slack to Shopify. Pretty much any software you and your team rely on can be grafted onto your shared CRM workspace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now more than ever <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/should-di-training-be-mandatory/">inclusion</a> is a measure of workplace culture and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/3-pieces-of-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-focused-research-to-inspire-your-own/">inequality across industries</a>. But what does it mean in the context of survey creation?</p>
<p>From their language to their respondent experience, the best surveys are built to be inclusive. In a broad sense, this means surveying with empathy, respect, and clear motives. You create an inclusive survey when you&rsquo;re thoughtful about how you ask respondents about things like religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Or when you plan respondents&rsquo; journey through your survey and consider why or when they might feel excluded. These simple acts make a big difference, and they help survey creators get in the habit of thinking inclusively.</p>
<p>While there isn&rsquo;t a set formula for creating an inclusive survey, there <em>are</em> some general principles you can keep in mind. Here are a few tips that will give you a baseline for creating inclusive surveys.</p>
<h2>Be mindful about your demographic questions</h2>
<p>Demographic questions focus on the identities of your respondents (such as age, race, gender, sexual orientation, and income), and including them in your surveys can help you get a clearer understanding of your audience.</p>
<p>But these questions, especially when they relate to diversity, equity, and inclusion, can feel personal. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be afraid of asking them&mdash;but it does mean that you should be clear about why you&rsquo;re asking and how you&rsquo;ll use that data. Knowing this will help you create better questions that are driven by intention.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re inspired to use this yes or no question from the Gallup tracking survey: &ldquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/201731/lgbt-identification-rises.aspx">Do you personally identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender?</a>&rdquo; This might get you an overall estimate of LGBTQ individuals. However, the question doesn&rsquo;t take into account the percent of individuals who identify as both straight and transgender. If your goal is to use that kind of specific data to understand the nuances of your respondents&rsquo; identities, you&rsquo;ll need to be more inclusive in how you ask this type of question.</p>
<p>Another way to make demographic questions feel inclusive is to include a fill-in-the-blank answer. When you&rsquo;re asking about religious, racial, or gender identities, there&rsquo;s always the risk that your respondents will fail to see themselves reflected in the answer options that you suggest. Including an option where they can write it in themselves will give them a better opportunity to be &ldquo;seen&rdquo; and might even give you ideas for future surveys.</p>
<h2>Be upfront about why you&rsquo;re asking demographic questions</h2>
<p>While some respondents may not hesitate to answer demographic questions, others will feel more comfortable sharing that information if they understand what your motivations are and how their responses will be used. This can be accomplished with a simple survey introduction that explains your survey&rsquo;s topic and purpose.</p>
<p>Context is key. A bookstore asking its survey respondents&rsquo; about their sexual orientation or gender identity may have an easier time if there is some indication that that data will be used to stock merchandise that&rsquo;s relevant to its customers or to plan community programming.</p>
<h2>Don&rsquo;t require answers to all your questions</h2>
<p>We found that 27% of respondents say that not being able to skip a question is enough to make them quit a survey completely. If a lot of people quit, you&rsquo;ll end up with less data&mdash;and that data is likely to be more homogeneous and less valuable.</p>
<p>Rather than requiring all your survey questions, give respondents the power to skip questions that make them feel uncomfortable. This will not only respect their boundaries, it will also keep them engaged and decrease the chance of survey fatigue.</p>
<h2>Use skip logic</h2>
<p>Another useful survey setting is skip logic, which allows you to send respondents to a certain question or page based on how they answer a certain question. In general, using skip logic makes your surveys stronger because it prevents respondents from seeing questions that don&rsquo;t apply to them.</p>
<p>How does this connect to inclusive survey design? Well, consider a survey that asks respondents for their religious affiliation. If a respondent selects &ldquo;no religion&rdquo; and then is asked about Christmas traditions or how often they attend church, they may feel that their answer isn&rsquo;t welcome or that they are not a valued part of your audience. Encountering irrelevant survey questions is frustrating, so they also might be tempted to quit your survey altogether.</p>
<p>The beauty of skip logic is that you can use it to tailor the survey experience for your respondents and develop a deeper understanding of their backgrounds and experiences.</p>
<h2>Be conscious of language</h2>
<p>Words are powerful and the words and phrasing you use in your survey questions can inadvertently exclude, offend, or marginalize certain people. To avoid this, it&rsquo;s important for your survey questions to reflect inclusive language. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/guidelines-inclusive-language">Linguistic Society of America</a> describes this as language that &ldquo;acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what does that mean in practice? Here are a just a few things you can do to make sure your survey language is inclusive:</p>
<h3>Consider the context, history, and meaning of your language</h3>
<p>Sometimes we toss off common words and phrases without fully understanding how they&rsquo;re perceived. For example, an insurance company surveying its customers about the &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; that will affect their memberships might not realize that that term is actually <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial-history-of-the-grandfather-clause">rooted in racism</a>.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for words or phrases that could carry unintended connotations so you can swap them out for better, more specific wording. You&rsquo;ll also want to avoid slang, idioms, or words that might have different meanings to different groups.</p>
<h3>Don&rsquo;t define what&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo;</h3>
<p>As you write survey questions, be careful not to center certain ideas or identities as &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; This includes trying to avoid the &ldquo;generic he,&rdquo; which is when we use male words or pronouns as a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; way to communicate. For example, asking respondents about their primary care doctor and whether <em>he</em> creates a welcoming environment.</p>
<p>Another example might be assuming that your audience went to college, has a job, or owns a house&mdash;privileges that don&rsquo;t apply to everyone. It&#8217;s always a good idea to read over your survey questions with an objective eye. (For more on using non-sexist language, check out the guidelines from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist?&amp;hhsearchterms=gender+and+neutral+and+language">The American Philosophical Association</a>.)</p>
<h3>Take advantage of expert resources</h3>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something you want to ask but you&rsquo;re not sure how to phrase it, it never hurts to consult resources like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://consciousstyleguide.com/">Conscious Style Guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.racialequityresourceguide.org/about/glossary">Racial Equity Resource Guide</a>. Zendesk writes about why <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/gendered-language-everyones-business/">gendered language</a> matters so much in customer service. And SurveyMonkey&rsquo;s question bank is full of expert-written questions that cover a variety of tricky topics, including race and religious affiliation.</p>
<p>Using these vetted questions means that you don&rsquo;t need to stress about the perfect way to approach sensitive or personal topics in your survey. They&rsquo;re designed to be objective and to use familiar language that feels natural rather than nosy.</p>
<h2>Design your survey with accessibility in mind</h2>
<p>Write for accessibility by keeping your questions clear and concise. If there is information that only comes across by looking at an image, try to include some context in the text of the question. If you&rsquo;re using colors and design to customize your survey, make sure your color contrasts are readable and try to keep your design <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94">as inclusive as possible</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, quality customer service is more important than ever. One in three customers are abandoning brands <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2018/08/05/what-customers-want-and-expect/">after a single bad experience</a>, causing U.S. companies more than <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2018/05/17/businesses-lose-75-billion-due-to-poor-customer-service/#:~:text=NewVoiceMedia's%202018%20%E2%80%9CSerial%20Switchers%E2%80%9D%20report,a%20better%20customer%20service%20experience.">$75 billion</a> in losses every year. But if you treat them right, customers will do a lot more than stay. Customers who feel valued are actually <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/pwc-consumers-will-pay-more-better-experience-418882">willing to spend <em>more</em></a> for the privilege of doing business with you.</p>
<p>Welcome to the experience economy: a new world where the goods and services of competing brands are so similar that the battleground for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/loyalty-rewards/">customer loyalty</a> has moved from providing better functionality to curating better experiences.</p>
<p>To compete for the customers of today, customer service teams need to evolve into customer experience teams. And they need a new kind of data to track their progress.</p>
<h2>What is experience data?</h2>
<p>Experience data (<strong>X-data</strong>) is the beliefs, emotions, and thoughts of customers. It can be captured through surveys, website forms, frontline employees, and many other customer feedback channels. While most of the data that businesses take into account is focused on &ldquo;what is happening&rdquo; &ndash; we call this operational data (<strong>O-data</strong>) &ndash; X-data can uncover the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>O-data may tell you that your customers are returning a newly-released winter coat at record levels. X-data can explain that customers didn&rsquo;t think it was warm enough.</li>
<li>O-data may tell you that cart abandonment is up on your ecommerce website. X-data can explain that customers became frustrated with a certain step in the checkout process.</li>
<li>O-data may tell you that a certain new hire hasn&rsquo;t been able to close as many tickets as others. X-data can explain that customers thought he was talking too much on their support calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to improve customer service using experience data</h2>
<p>X-data is only a competitive advantage if you know how to use it. Here are three ways that you can leverage the currency of the experience economy:</p>
<h3>1. Track the right <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-metrics-matter/">metrics</a> and benchmark against competitors</h3>
<p>Meaningful improvement always starts with measurement. Customer service teams have traditionally relied on metrics like average hold time and issues resolution rates. But those metrics only tell you what your customer service team is doing. Experience data will give you new, customer-focused metrics to set goals around, like:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS).</strong> Net promoter score measures customer loyalty based on one simple survey question: &ldquo;How likely is it that you would recommend [Organization X/Product Y/Service Z] to a friend or colleague?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction (CSAT).</strong> CSAT measures customer satisfaction based on the question: &ldquo;How would you rate your overall satisfaction with the [goods/service] you received?&rdquo; Respondents use a rating scale between 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).</li>
<li><strong>Customer effort score (CES).</strong> Customer effort score asks a question like: &ldquo;How easy was it to deal with our company today?&rdquo; giving simple options: Easy, Neither, Difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three simple metrics can give you insight into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/customer-experience/">overall customer experience</a> that you provide, and will allow you to benchmark against other experience-minded businesses in your industry.</p>
<h3>2. Solve problems before they affect the bottom line</h3>
<p>If your organization is closely following the mood of its customers, it will be able to get ahead of issues before they spiral out of control. X-data allows you to notice a problem when it is surfaced by a single customer, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to wait for it to begin affecting your entire business before making a change. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>One customer may have had a terrible support experience with a new hire. If you have feedback surveys automatically going out to customers after each support interaction, you can know to better train (or potentially fire) that employee before they upset others.</li>
<li>One customer may stumble across an embarrassing typo on your website. If you have a feedback tab available, they can easily let you know before several high-profile prospects see it.</li>
<li>One customer may post about how a product they purchased from you arrived already broken. If you&rsquo;re monitoring social media mentions, you can resolve the problem with them before it goes viral.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gathering X-data from across channels like those described above into easy-to-understand dashboards and actionable workflows will allow you to surface and solve issues in real-time. Customer service teams will be able to reduce the amount of incoming complaints, and have more time to think about proactive initiatives.</p>
<h3>3. Refine internal processes and trainings</h3>
<p>With more input from customers, you can better understand the support pathways they&rsquo;d prefer to travel. For example, you may learn in a survey that many of your customers prefer to call in to a physical support center and talk to a real human. In a different organization, however, you may learn that customer satisfaction increases when self-help options are provided on the company website. This information will guide you as you consider adopting new systems.</p>
<p>You can also use the data to identify ways to better train the team &#8211; as a whole, and as individuals. When customers are asked to stay on the line and provide feedback after a support call, or are sent a follow-up email asking for their input you have given them a key opportunity to improve your business. Look for the trends in customer feedback that may indicate deficiencies in the way your team handles specific scenarios, and train team members to overcome them.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask your team about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-accelerate/our-insights/closing-the-capability-gap-in-the-time-of-covid-19">their experiences as employees</a> too. Employee turnover can be high on customer support teams. Listening to and acting on employee concerns can increase retention and gives your customers the benefits of interacting with more experienced, more engaged staff.</p>
<h2>Listen and take action today</h2>
<p>All of this starts with listening to your customers more &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t end until you take action. That&rsquo;s why Zendesk and Qualtrics have teamed up.</p>
<p>By bringing the X-data that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.qualtrics.com/platform/">Qualtrics Experience Management Platform</a> gathers into Zendesk customer service workflows, organizations can close the loop faster with customers, and gain deeper insight into the customer service experience. You can start automatically sending data from Qualtrics surveys to Zendesk Support today by enabling our joint integration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was a year when &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t really an option. Many sales teams found that COVID had rendered parts of their usual approach ineffective. As companies adapted to the pandemic, they discovered that some changes were worth making permanent.</p>
<p>To get a sense of what <em>is</em> working nowadays, we talked to three sales leaders who are successfully weathering this tumultuous period. It turns out they&rsquo;ve been using a lot of the same methodologies, tools, and on-the-fly adjustments to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/improve-sales-process/">improve their sales process</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Adopt a MEDDPIC sales qualification framework</h2>
<p>When Zendesk got its revenue forecasts to land within 1% of actual revenue, they didn&rsquo;t credit the incredible accuracy to any data science team or AI tech. They <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.closeplanapp.com/blog-article/2018/07/27/3-steps-to-accurate-forecasting/">talked about</a> process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first step of improving a sales process is having a sales process,&rdquo; says <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hansen-a972b36/">Andrew Hansen</a>, Director of Enterprise and Commercial Sales at <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/features/#features">Zendesk Sell</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important that all the reps understand the standard aspects that increase the likelihood of closing an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew and other sales leaders we spoke with use the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-methodology/#meddpic">MEDDPIC sales methodology</a> to qualify their potential B2B sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MEDDPIC basically is a way for leadership to be able to look at opportunities and gauge the likelihood that they will convert on time,&rdquo; explains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-labbe/">Olivier L&rsquo;Abbe</a>, President of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://metadata.io/">Metadata.io</a>, an autonomous demand generation platform for B2B marketers.</p>
<p>MEDDPIC is an acronym for the seven elements you need to know about any company you&rsquo;re attempting to sell to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong> The quantifiable measures of value that your solution will provide to the company, like the amount of money they would make (or save) by using your product</li>
<li><strong>Economic Buyer:</strong> The ultimate decision-maker at the company, who you need to win over</li>
<li><strong>Decision Criteria:</strong> The considerations the company will weigh when deciding whether to purchase &ndash; technical requirements, budgetary constraints, and ROI</li>
<li><strong>Decision Process:</strong> How the company will reach their decision &ndash; who are the stakeholders involved, and what is their system for approving a deal</li>
<li><strong>Paper Process:</strong> The contracts required and the steps needed to process and sign the order</li>
<li><strong>Implications of Pain:</strong> The pain points for the company &ndash; what problems they need to solve, and what will happen if they can&rsquo;t solve them</li>
<li><strong>Champion:</strong> The person at the company who most strongly feels the pain points and will tirelessly advocate for your solution</li>
</ul>
<p>The methodology was first developed as &ldquo;MEDDIC&rdquo; in the 1990s, but the &ldquo;P&rdquo; has subsequently proved to be a pivotal addition.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wardledan/">Dan Wardle</a>, VP of Revenue at the online video platform <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vidyard.com/">Vidyard</a>, says his team uses MEDDPIC because the paperwork process tends to be half the deal length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MEDDPIC&rsquo;s really important to make sure you&rsquo;re documenting all of that,&rdquo; Dan explains. &ldquo;So then, after three months of going through legal, you can go back to the stakeholders to remind them why they&rsquo;re buying.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>2. Embrace remote work</h2>
<p>Though a pandemic may have forced their hands, our experts are now recognizing the benefits of letting their teams work remotely.</p>
<p>Vidyard has recently announced that it&rsquo;s going to be digital-first moving forward. Part of what&rsquo;s made that possible is a willingness to be flexible with meetings.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    Metadata.io’s staff is now 90% remote – likely for good.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When the sales teams first went remote, they&rsquo;d have virtual morning huddles every day. But after a few weeks, some reps got tired of the meetings &ndash; which put them in the wrong mood for making sales calls.</p>
<p>Now Dan tells them, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to join the meeting, no problem. But send us a video showing that you&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority of Dan&rsquo;s reps are now able to make more calls than ever. And though distraction can be an issue, he says setting fast deadlines helps keep everyone productive and engaged.</p>
<p>Olivier told us that Metadata.io&rsquo;s staff is now 90% remote &ndash; likely for good. His big takeaway has been learning to loosen up his management style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be a pretty strict type of leader,&rdquo; says Olivier. &ldquo;I wanted people in the office, I wanted X amount of activities, I needed X amount of cause meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, he no longer feels the need to closely monitor each rep&rsquo;s performance metrics. However, if someone on the team does start underperforming, he can still check their KPIs to see what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<h2>3. Get reps on board with a freemium sales model</h2>
<p>Transitioning to a freemium model can be challenging, but it&rsquo;s a great way to expand your reach.</p>
<p>Vidyard started off selling to enterprise organizations but transitioned to a freemium service a little over a year ago. When the pandemic hit, they started seeing quadruple numbers of free users.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We offered even more free products to the market to help people get through all this,&rdquo; Dan says.</p>
<p>Their generosity was rewarded when the spike in free users eventually translated to more sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Dan says, &ldquo;companies are reaching out and saying, &lsquo;actually, you know what, I need this for all 500 of my reps &ndash; let&rsquo;s talk more.&rdquo;</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    &#8220;85% of our pipeline is coming from free users&#8221;
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When Vidyard first made the switch, though, the biggest hurdle was sales reps&rsquo; mentality. Not only were reps worried about users just sticking with the free version, but they also had to rewire their sales process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the biggest part, just overcoming this sales rep fear that it was going to kill their deals or slow their deals down,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;But now, 85% of our pipeline is coming from free users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s sales reps are now showing off the paid version of the product earlier on, since free users already have some familiarity with the service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a traditional enterprise, you won&rsquo;t even demo in the first call, right?&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Then, after you do a demo, you won&rsquo;t give them pricing until they join the next call. But we&rsquo;ve flipped that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And since users have already seen pricing details on Vidyard&rsquo;s website, the reps are discussing discounts and deals sooner than ever before.</p>
<h2>4. Show some contract flexibility</h2>
<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t go full freemium, there are other ways to broaden your product&rsquo;s appeal. Offering shorter contracts is another adjustment that may seem scary but can ultimately pay big dividends.</p>
<p>Most SaaS companies stick to 12-month contracts because they rely so heavily on annual recurring revenue (ARR). But because Metadata.io was focused on revenue growth at the start of 2020, they gave account executives the ability to offer six-month pilots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on what was happening with COVID, and based on the fact that we were trying to penetrate as many accounts as quickly as possible, a six month proof of concept was a really easy way to get that approved,&rdquo; Olivier explains.</p>
<p>The approach was successful in generating new customers &ndash; so much so that they&rsquo;re reaching the limit for onboarding new accounts. In response, they&rsquo;re moving back toward longer contracts and finding ways to generate more revenue from existing customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at 12-month contracts, and we are increasing the amount of required ad spend that customers now do with us, because we are moving up market,&rdquo; Olivier says. &ldquo;And those are the new metrics that we are trying to achieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metadata.io&rsquo;s story shows the advantages of taking an agile approach to your sales process. Once they&rsquo;d accomplished their initial goal, they were able to pivot their focus from shorter contracts to more lucrative relationships.</p>
<h2>5. Add value with every follow-up</h2>
<p>The key to getting and keeping a prospect&rsquo;s attention is demonstrating value &#8211; so don&rsquo;t stop demonstrating it.</p>
<p>Build out economic business cases for every key opportunity. Following the MEDDPIC framework, calculate the ROI for the prospect&rsquo;s company and show them the metrics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t point to a return on investment or show what financial change is occurring by them making a purchase, the likelihood of closing that opportunity decreases significantly,&rdquo; Andrew warns.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    The key to getting and keeping a prospect’s attention is demonstrating value.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Emphasize the economic benefits up front. With every subsequent interaction with a prospect, continue to find ways to show them your brand&rsquo;s value. Instead of sending a rote follow-up email, you might share a relevant article in your message. Be sure to always relate the resource back to one of their goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;re engaging with them, I think the big thing is bringing value to every conversation,&rdquo; Olivier says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in sales cycles where I don&#8217;t feel the account executive is bringing much value, because he keeps following up with me, saying, &lsquo;Just following up over here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to ignore every &ldquo;just following up over here&rdquo; email you get. But a &ldquo;this article reminded me of what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish this quarter&rdquo; email has some value to it.</p>
<h2>6. Improve your sales process with targeted tools</h2>
<p>The leaders we spoke to have streamlined their sales processes by leveraging both their own SaaS products and additional software solutions.</p>
<p>Of course, a CRM is pretty essential to any sales operation. Andrew says the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/features/crm-software/">Sell CRM</a> is particularly well-suited to the MEDDPIC framework because it captures activities, labels, and notes for each account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a manager, it&rsquo;s very easy for me to dive in and understand from a MEDDPIC perspective where that opportunity is,&rdquo; Andrew explains. &ldquo;The activity tracker makes it very easy to understand the qualification of each opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly, Dan says Vidyard uses its own video platform to condense the sales process as much as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of having a proposal meeting where you don&rsquo;t show the pricing until the last slide, send that as a video, and see who watches it,&rdquo; Dan recommends. &ldquo;Did the CFO even watch it? If not, then this deal is not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vidyard reps also use the platform to book meetings, since folks are less likely to bail on an appointment if they receive a personalized video.</p>
<p>Dan says his team has also started using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/cx/18/08/linkedin-sales-navigator?src=go-pa&amp;trk=sem_lss_gaw&amp;veh=LSS_NAMER_T1_US_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Contextual_SalesNavigator-Alpha_All_English_Core_308336719120__linkedin%20sales%20navigator_e_c__&amp;mcid=6625793832262914073&amp;cname=LSS_NAMER_T1_US_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Contextual_SalesNavigator-Alpha_All_English_Core&amp;camid=1047480706&amp;asid=50981825506&amp;targetid=kwd-310899651265&amp;crid=308336719120&amp;placement=&amp;dev=c&amp;ends=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5p_8BRBUEiwAPpJO67UVsm0RAOXxQ3294g3T73ZSv926NDPmqasTT7uG7ddbVsbcWv5B2BoCs-MQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">LinkedIn Sales Navigator</a> to find phone numbers, many of which changed when everyone went remote.</p>
<h2>Solidify your sales process &ndash; then prepare to adjust</h2>
<p>Every organization needs a standardized sales process for reps to follow. But as 2020 has reminded us, every organization also needs to be ready to adapt that process if and when conditions change.</p>
<p>With a CRM like Sell, you can actively <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050658574-Reflecting-your-sales-processes-in-Zendesk-Sell">manage your sales process</a>, track and convert leads, and monitor your sales pipelines.

<p>In our hyper-connected digital age, it’s easy to feel like we have visibility into everything around us. We see our friends updating their Instagram stories, our colleagues on Slack and LinkedIn, our matches on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/hinge-muted-gamification-dating/">Hinge</a>, our meals on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/grubhub/">GrubHub</a>, our groceries on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/instacart/">Instacart</a> — okay, maybe we compartmentalize more than we realize. But why should that stop us from breaking down barriers at work?</p>
<p>We could all be a little better at seeing the big picture. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp">Organizational silos</a> should be a thing of the past, but we all know that old and patchwork-connected software are inhibiting us from sourcing and acting upon important data. Every aspect of the customer journey can produce useful insights, and thanks to software that brings together and visualizes data, we can act on these insights to affect change across the organization.  </p>

<h2>Sales data</h2>
<p>If your company is using a sales CRM, you’re sitting on a wealth of insight that can be drawn up and turned into actionable insights. If your company isn’t using a sales CRM, it might be high time to liberate yourselves from the spreadsheets and email threads.</p>
<p>Within your sales CRM, there is a certain amount of self-monitoring your agents can do. It’s reasonable to expect an agent to be on top of their own calls and pipeline — and good for their managers to have visibility into their team’s data too. Typically, a sales manager might track the number of calls per day, the pipeline created per week, the number of meetings per week, and the stage of deals. Keeping track of all of this in a spreadsheet sounds daunting, but using a real-time dashboard, or widgets embedded in the CRM make it easier to visualize, track, and share this data.</p>
<p>Sales data, like total sales, funnel, where deals are in your pipeline, which deal sources are successful, and how sales reps are doing, can be analyzed and lined up against company goals. And when it comes to sales data, the more you collect, the better. The largest data set possible will give your team the more accurate insight. Expensify, a Zendesk customer, analyzed millions of data points around their sales activities and quickly found opportunities to improve their sales process.</p>

</section>
<section id="section-2">
<h2>Service data</h2>
<p>To understand why service data is important, we need to understand what modern self-service looks like. Rather than considering self-service to be its own channel (ie, a knowledge base stocked with articles), it’s helpful to consider the ways self-service intersects with other channels. </p>
<p>Chatbots are an example of self-service in live-chat and messaging. A chatbot is often the first point of contact for a person reaching out to customer service. While the customer may want to speak to a person, it’s possible their query can be deflected to a self-service help desk article, or answered by the bot. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/">Answer Bot</a>, which can be programmed into Zendesk’s live-chat and messaging solutions, offers up help center articles as a first point of service unless the customer wishes to escalate to an agent. Flow Builder, an out-of-the-box decision tree, can be used to program Answer Bot to make more complex decisions. </p>
<p>Tracking and iterating on data relating to self-service can help companies create a targeted approach to better serve their customers. Why prioritize self-service? It might be better for your business. Since the start of the pandemic, companies of all stripes have seen <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesks-benchmark-snapshot-impact-covid-19-cx/">a surge in tickets</a>, and the most agile of them are prioritizing self service. Over <a href="https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/Agile-Organization/Agility-starts-with-self-service">70% of these agile companies</a> have added new articles to keep pace with evolving customer needs, and at least 1 in 5 have increased the number of dedicated agents.</p>
<p>To track service data in Zendesk, users can access and share numerous dashboards. For example, a dashboard showing bot answers and resolutions by date to find out where bots can step in, or where to build out conversational flows that lead to resolution. A dashboard that shows resolution and click-through rates by date might show when customers are uninterested in self-service and prefer real-time conversations — which could be further reflected in a dashboard showing agent-assisted versus unassisted bot resolutions. And to see which helpdesk articles need to stay updated, users can table Answer Bot activity by article. If certain articles are getting the bulk of attention, the data might be able to help you figure out what it is about your product or service that could be improved.</p>

</section>
<section id="section-3">
<h2>Customer data </h2>
<p>Customer data can be broken down into two categories: Data <em>about</em> the customer, and KPIs from your customer base. </p>
<p>Data about the customer, like their name, their conversation history, preferred channels, or previous purchases, are relevant to your agents because it provides the context needed to create personalized and efficient customer experiences, as well as more personalized and engaging interactions. A customer who starts a conversation with a bot, for example, shouldn’t have to repeat themselves when an agent takes over. A customer who starts a conversation via chat before getting a follow up email shouldn’t have to repeat themselves either. Highlighting and displaying relevant information for agents — while keeping customer data secure — is key to eliminating common CX roadblocks. </p>
<p>Customer service KPIs, like CSAT (customer satisfaction), ATR (average time to resolution), or FRT (first response time) tell you a lot about how your support team is doing. Different channels have different average response times. Different channels have different average CSAT scores — and so do different rated tickets. Zendesk users can access dashboards that show CSAT scores alongside rated tickets by date to get an impression of how their support team is handling customer requests. These dashboards can be sliced by channel or priority to see which are doing well and which need improvement. Insights gleaned from these dashboards can affect the customer experience directly, especially if your team decides to add more channels.</p>
<p align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-kpis-need-track/">6 customer service KPIs you need to track</a></p>
</section>
<h2>Why integrate your data?</h2>
<p>Seeing the big picture means integrating data from across the organization. Integrating data means understanding customer health and proactively resolving issues. It means measuring and attributing revenue across your sales and service teams, and gives your teams context between sales and service interactions so they can provide better, more personalized experiences. Ultimately, the best customer experience is data driven. </p>
<p>Sales data, customer data, and self-service data might be different arms of your organization, but they all lead to the heart of the business. The right software can help you track, share, analyze, and iterate on crucial data sets — so you can finally cut through organizational silos and be better for your customers, prospects, and organization. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot goes into delivering a great customer experience (CX), but it can be hard to know where to make the most strategic investments. To help businesses make good, data-driven decisions, Zendesk partnered with ESG Research to build a framework around CX maturity and CX success. The findings for companies based in Europe and the United Kingdom are summarized in this report: <em>CX Champions: How CX Leaders Who Raise Their Game Are Driving Business Success</em>.</p>
<p>After interviewing CX leaders from all over the world, ESG identified three levels of CX maturity: the Champions, the Risers, and the Starters. Respectively, those are: businesses with a boast-worthy, well-oiled CX operation, businesses that are still gaining ground, and businesses that are at risk of falling behind. This report is based on survey data from 250 companies based in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second time I speak with Colleen Berube, CIO and SVP of Operations at Zendesk, she greets me over Zoom from her backyard in San Mateo, California. The scene looks idyllic, though the reality is that wildfires are raging all over the state, the air is tinged with smoke, and we all remain hunkered down at home as Covid wears on. Rewind several months and the situation was much different—we met in a glassed-in conference room at our headquarters in downtown San Francisco, on the heels of her first anniversary at Zendesk. </p>
<p>“I was excited to join a company where customer experience is the centerpiece of the product and conversation,” Berube said at the time. Experiences are, after all, what people are buying—whether that’s a standout experience or simply a smooth one, where it’s easy to transact business and the customer gets exactly what they expect. </p>
<p>“I’m passionate about the customer experience, how it’s changing and the way that technology and the market are generating ever-increasing customer expectations,” she said.</p>
<p>Before joining, Berube served as executive vice president and chief technology officer at Fisher Investments and as executive in residence at PwC, following a long tenure as vice president of Business Services at Adobe. This means Berube has lived and breathed high-growth momentum. “The pace and energy and optimism at this stage makes it one of my favorite times to be at a company,” she said in March 2020.</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2>Addressing the digital transformation imperative</h2>
<p>No longer a back office “keeping the lights on” role, today’s best CIOs are customer-facing and driving digital transformation—connecting the dots between what internal teams are working to accomplish for external customers and building the infrastructure that will work holistically across an organization.</p>
<p>And if things were moving fast before Covid, they’re moving faster now, according to analysts. In fact, Gartner’s website <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/role/cio-it-executives">reads</a>: “The pace of digital business will never be this slow again.” Scott Engler, VP of Advisory for CFO/CHRO for Gartner, says that the coronavirus has sped up the timeline for digital transformation by years. </p>
<p>Similarly, McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-strategy-in-a-time-of-crisis">reports</a> that there is no time like the present. “Strange as it may seem, right now, in a moment of crisis, is precisely the time to boldly advance your digital agenda.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Strange as it may seem, right now, in a moment of crisis, is precisely the time to boldly advance your digital agenda.” &#8211; McKinsey”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>For Berube, the past few months were as validating as they were challenging. Zendesk, like so many other companies, shifted to working 100 percent virtually, but because the company’s products and the technologies it uses are cloud-based, the transition was fairly seamless.</p>
<p>“For every CIO I’ve talked to, being 100 percent cloud- and SaaS-based led to, on some level, both validation and a realization that the way we’re accustomed to working is essential for being ready for what lies ahead,” she said.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/speeding-up-digital-transformation/">From 3 years to 8 weeks—digital transformation is speeding up</a>]</em></p>
<h2>Rebuilding to center on EX and CX</h2>
<p>Before the onset of coronavirus, Berube was already deep into transforming the way Zendesk does business. “The philosophy here is that we really want to be the best demonstration of a modern company. Our goal is to be the first and best customer of Zendesk.” </p>
<p>Accomplishing this requires overhauling Zendesk’s internal use of its own products, with a mission to rebuild on top of the company’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/platform/">Zendesk Sunshine</a> platform. By doing this, and by leveraging the company’s own professional services, customer success and solution consulting organizations, it gives us unique insight into the end-customer experience and to identify opportunities for improvement. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The philosophy here is that we really want to be the best demonstration of a modern company. Our goal is to be the first and best customer of Zendesk.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The goal, Berube says, is to make it easy to do business with Zendesk, and also for “employees to live the Zendesk experience whenever they need help internally.” By using our own products, all of our employees understand our products better, can appreciate our customers&#8217; experience better and become true evangelists for doing the right thing for our customers.</p>
<p>The two experiences—employee and customer—are inextricably linked. A recent Forrester report <a href="https://www.concur.co.uk/resource-centre/reports/forrester-improve-travel-expense-invoice-management-solution-to-drive-better-employee-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that companies with the most engaged employees enjoy 81 percent higher customer satisfaction, experience half the turnover of their peers and have a decisive competitive advantage.</p>
<p>“As a CIO, you have to learn not only the technology and how it runs the business, but also you really must learn the business of the company and how each part of the organization functions,” she explained. “The modern role of IT is no longer about running all the technology, but to guide and govern choices, define architecture and solutions, and develop the services that connect everything.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/good-employee-experience-backbone-good-customer-experience/">Why a good employee experience is the backbone of good customer experience</a>]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The modern role of IT is no longer about running all the technology, but to guide and govern choices, define architecture and solutions, and develop the services that connect everything.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It’s not unusual in an enterprise that sales will focus on improving the sales experience, and e-commerce will look at the digital experience, and customer advocacy will helm the support experience, but the time has come to build, measure, and iterate on an end-to-end customer experience. “The more we can understand what each part of the organization is trying to do, the better overall experience we can build.”</p>
<p>To emphasize the importance of experience and thinking end to end, Berube reorganized her team  around these two key areas: Customer Experience Systems and Employee Experience Systems.“We used Zendesk for both of these experiences and I really wanted the teams to be thinking in focused ways about the respective experience from the outside in.”</p>
<p>Much as consumers expect an omnichannel experience with businesses, the future for Zendesk employees is an “engage anywhere” experience. The vision is that employees can ask any question or report any issue, regardless of the topic (e.g., HR, Finance, IT) through any channel (phone, chat, email, Slack), and get an easy answer or a ticket opened automatically. “We’re putting Zendesk technology in place to power that vision,” she said.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-needs/">How to anticipate your customer needs and solve them</a>]</em></p>
<h2>Architecting for agility and scale</h2>
<p>Since joining, Berube was promoted to SVP of Operations in addition to her role as CIO. Today she oversees global IT, operations, business applications and enterprise architecture, enterprise data and analytics, and global program management—including oversight of more than 200 employees.</p>
<p>As she well knows, growth requires flexibility. This is why key initiatives in 2020 include upgrading and simplifying the buying experience, optimizing key touchpoints along the customer lifecycle—including implementation of workflow management technology—and re-imagining the employee experience through a rebuilt Zendesk instance, new intranet, and increased automation. In short, it’s about empowering employees on the back end to be able to more efficiently serve their customers.</p>
<p>“The work we’ve done over the past year has allowed us to identify root causes behind some of our customer pain points,” Berube said. Already, the changes her org made led to self-service customer expansion of $25M in the first half of 2020, approximately 2,800 hours of reclaimed sales time, and a 25 percent reduction in customer credits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In short, it’s about empowering employees on the back end to be able to more efficiently serve their customers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>IT organizations within high-growth companies have to prepare for global expansion (Zendesk has 17 global offices), ensuring their businesses can scale with the rapid growth, continual and increased employee onboarding, and now, supporting virtual-first workplaces. Building a nimble cloud-based architecture means constantly reviewing your footprint and looking for opportunities to work more efficiently <em>and</em> champion initiatives that drive revenue growth. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/cloud-100-startups-cx/">Why Cloud 100 startups are investing in CX</a>]</em></p>
<p>“Speed and agility are two of our most-valued attributes at Zendesk, and IT both demonstrates and enables them,” Berube said. </p>
<p>The number of technologies presented to leaders today is not consumable, she explained. Looking at just the marketing space alone, there’s over 8,000 different software choices. Some 25 years ago, IT leaders had computer science degrees, but today the software is more sophisticated and plenty of people have the talent to manage their applications. “My view is that we can move from the stance of command and control to guide and govern,” she said. It’s about “understanding the needs of employees and our business to ensure the technology meets our needs and that the business can grow.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year — unless you’re sitting on hold with a customer service department.</p>
<p>No customer wants to be stuck on the phone this holiday season, or passed from agent to agent as they try to find answers. It’s a quick way to end up on anyone’s naughty list, so companies should do what they can to help their customers spend less time trying to solve their issue and more time with the things (and people!) that matter most. </p>
<h2>Deck the halls, with rising support requests</h2>
<p>Customer service has been anything but normal this year. Home-bound customers have been interacting with companies in new and different ways, and support teams have been managing a holiday-like rush for most of the year, all while many have been working from home. </p>
<p>With the holidays fast approaching, even the most seasoned teams will want to take stock of their support operations and make sure they’re well prepared for whatever the season may bring. Online retailers were managing 50 percent more customer tickets in August than they did the previous year, while traditional retailers have seen a 23 percent bump.</p>
<blockquote><p>Self-service adoption is up 106 percent among traditional retailers who have successfully kept resolution times stable this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which channels are seeing the biggest jumps? Customers are flocking to online help centers, where views are up more than 40 percent. And WhatsApp use has jumped nearly 300 percent during the pandemic, with chat and text also rising in popularity.  </p>
<p>The holidays are traditionally the busiest time of the year, but with so many retailers already managing a rush, it’s worth looking at where they’ve seen the most success:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<h3>Help yourself</h3>
<p>Self-service adoption is up 106 percent among traditional retailers who have successfully kept resolution times stable this year. By letting customers find answers themselves, these retailers are saving them from having to reach out in the first place and keeping agents focused on more complex problems. </p>
<p>More than half of those retailers who already have a help center in place are adding new content and dedicating more agents to the effort. </li>
<li>
<h3>Let’s chat</h3>
<p>Chat support solves customer issues in real time, which means it’s a great way to keep resolution times low. And though messaging has seen a massive boost in popularity, chat remains one of the most popular ways for customers to connect with retailers.</p>
<p>Chat support adoption among retailers who have managed to keep resolution times from rising rose 10.3 percent since February. And nearly a third of those who already have the channel saw a significant bump in ticket volumes over chat, more than any other channel.</li>
<li>
<h3>Keeping it efficient</h3>
<p>When ticket volume is high, it’s helpful to have a streamlined support operation. This means that tickets are getting to the right people, simple tasks are automated, and agents can access the resources they need in scalable and repeatable ways. </p>
<p>Retailers that are keeping things efficient have increased their use of such workflow management tools by 11 percent since February. They’ve also increased their use of in-house or third party apps (available through the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/">Zendesk Marketplace</a>), which can help add further functionality for support teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>‘Tis the season for change</h2>
<p>Despite the surge in messaging tickets, retailers haven’t been as quick to adopt these new channels, even as other sectors have jumped on board. Why not? </p>
<p>Lower adoption rates, even as customers flock to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, suggest that teams new to messaging may be unsure about how to get started. Or they may not know how to integrate these channels into their larger support strategies.</p>
<p>Retailers must continue to evolve if they want to continue to meet the changing needs and preferences of their customers. Those waiting for things to “go back to normal” will almost certainly get left behind. </p>
<p>With a holistic look at where your customers are and where they need you to be, as well as how you can better streamline your internal workflows, retailers can be better prepared for the holiday season and whatever comes next. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Eric Grandon discovered beekeeping, he had no idea that the bees would give him the power to transform both his own life and the lives of many others.</p>
<p>After serving 20 years in the U.S. military, Eric retired to his family farm in West Virginia, but he was haunted by his experiences in combat. After a particularly harrowing flashback, he was diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
<p>Beekeeping was first used as rehab for soldiers suffering &#8220;shell shock&#8221; after the First World War. Finding himself suddenly at peace, Eric knew he had to help others. Now, he invites other veterans and first-line responders to his farm so they can experience the healing powers of beekeeping.</p>

<p><p>We’re sharing Eric’s story on Veterans Day, in honor of the service he and so many others have provided. Laurence McKevitt, a member of Zendesk’s Global Veterans Network Employee Resource Group saw his own experience reflected in the film. “I found the video to be thought-provoking, sweet, and really truthful,” he shared. McKevitt entered the service at age 17, in Ireland, and left on his first tour of duty to Lebanon the following year. McKevitt spent 12 years in military service, including 4 tours in parts of Africa and the Middle East. “Not feeling prepared for ‘peace time’ is very true,” he said. “It took some time for me to find something to help transition from one path to another. For me it was music, studying it in depth. It helped me to feel calm and transition into a new career.”</p>

<h2>Helping each other help each other</h2>
<p>We each feel called, in different times and ways, to be helpful to those around us—to our customers, our colleagues, our friends and family, and the wider community. Helping is in our connective tissue—and it’s what brings the Zendesk community together. It’s what we do, because we, and our customers, are people who want to <strong>be helpful</strong>.</p>
<p>While we believe software lays the foundation for great customer experiences, it’s really the attitude of our users, agents, managers—our <em>community</em>—that makes the change. And that helpful attitude has the potential to change the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Helping is in our connective tissue—and it’s what brings the Zendesk community together.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why we’re launching a project to share stories like Eric’s—these aren’t your typical support stories, but instead inspiring stories about people who heed the call to help in surprising ways. And these stories are all around us. Sometimes we help each other in ways that are expected, by lending a hand or answering a question. Other times, a single act of helpfulness can take on a meaningful life of its own.</p>
<p>No matter the form that help takes, one thing is certain: Being helpful isn’t always easy—it can be a lot of work. That’s why we’re excited to continue sharing these stories with you, our community, to remember that we’re all in this together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Zendesk, we’re big believers in the power of messaging to keep people together. </p>
<p>While the momentum behind messaging has been building up for a decade, we’ve seen the use of messaging apps grow exponentially during the past year. The pandemic, which has changed the way we live, has also changed how we communicate, connect, and work. With platforms like Facebook — WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram Direct — seeing increased usage across all their properties in the first half of 2020, it’s no surprise that businesses have gotten the message too.</p>
<h2>We’re excited to announce our new messaging partnership with Facebook <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>
<p>Facebook’s family of apps are familiar figures in our daily lives. The move to messaging marks a natural shift in communication for businesses, too  — there are already 40 million businesses active on Messenger alone, WhatsApp’s usage has <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/home-bound-customers-turn-to-messaging/">surged up to 164%</a> in Latin America, and Instagram has recently opened their API to businesses for the first time. </p>
<p>With Zendesk’s vision of keeping the customer at the center of everything, improving the agent experience, and deriving insight from customer conversations, our partnership with Facebook is critical to incorporating modern messaging throughout the customer journey. We are committed to helping businesses <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">embrace the trends</a> that are here to stay.</p>
<p>Zendesk’s new messaging capabilities and Answer Bot with Flow Builder are helping our customers provide conversational experiences that flow seamlessly across channels and devices while remaining engaging, personal and contextual. Our partnership with Facebook, which provides Zendesk business customers access to simple API tools to connect with their customers on WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, is integral to this evolution.</p>

<p>“It’s critical that we are constantly in communication with customers, which is why our support teams rely on Zendesk to share real-time information and immediately respond to questions across channels like Facebook. Messaging is becoming the default mode of communication, and we’re looking forward to making the customer experience even more engaging across additional messaging channels with these new Zendesk capabilities.” </p>

<h3>Better social messaging</h3>
<p>Messaging apps meet peoples’ expectations for convenience. People are rapidly shifting to messaging apps as the primary way to communicate with friends, family, and businesses. Worldwide, 175 million people already message business accounts on WhatsApp, and users are delivering roughly 100 <em>billion</em> messages <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/whatsapp-is-now-delivering-roughly-100-billion-messages-a-day/">every day</a>. </p>
<p>For Zendesk customers, conversations from WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram can be set up in the Admin Center alongside other social channels so agents can engage faster, enable conversational commerce, and solve issues more quickly. Zendesk’s ongoing collaboration with Facebook will ensure focus on the most important product capabilities to get customers up and running more quickly. </p>
<p align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/embedded-messaging/">Read more about Zendesk&#8217;s new messaging capabilities</a></p>
<p>Our unified agent workspace allows support teams to manage and respond to customers from any channel in a single place, with complete conversation history and context — which means customers don’t have to repeat themselves. Customers can start a conversation on the web, and carry it on their preferred messaging app — be it WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram — on their own terms and when it’s convenient for them. </p>
<h3>Enhancing customer conversations</h3>
<p>With features built into Facebook’s products, like Instagram’s “DM me” story sticker, click-to-message Facebook ads, and click-to-chat WhatsApp buttons, it’s effortless for businesses to start conversations with their customers. </p>
<p>In order to scale conversations across messaging channels, brands can automate FAQs, set autoresponders, and build AI-powered workflows with Answer Bot — straight out of the box. Support teams can easily build conversational flows within Zendesk without needing to code. For example, a retailer can offer support on FAQs like store locations, payments, or shipping and returns. When customers message the business, they will be greeted by a bot — but if the customer requires immediate assistance, they can escalate to a live conversation on their favorite channel. </p>
<p>It’s easier than ever to manage your customer conversations with Zendesk. Zendesk’s platform offerings will make creating custom conversational experiences on owned messaging channels, alongside Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram feel intuitive and effortless. </p>

<p>Messaging is everything right now. Our world is <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/messaging-apps-help-connect-immigrant-diaspora-communities/">threaded together by conversations</a> that happen on the apps we use every day. It’s no wonder we&#8217;ve seen a 50% surge in messaging-based support tickets over the past eight months.</p>
<p>But while social messaging channels like WhatsApp have gotten much of the attention recently, customers and businesses have been chatting with each other for a long time. Once the new kid on the block, live chat is now a familiar customer service channel. Folks who don’t want to talk on the phone or wait all day for an email can chat with a customer service rep in the same way they might chat online with a friend. It has worked out great for businesses, too: Their customers get help in real time, in the context of their website instead of being forced to poke around for an email address, a phone number, or a web form.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is live chat for the modern consumer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to bring the modern messaging experience your customers know and love to your business’ own web and mobile properties.</p>
<p>Think of this as live chat for the messaging age.</p>

<h2>Messaging is easier for customers</h2>
<h3>Customers don’t have to repeat themselves</h3>
<p>While live chat is a great solution if an issue needs to get resolved then and there, one of its limitations is that it’s limited to sessions: As soon as a chat ends, the conversation history disappears into the ether. Everyone knows what it’s like to wait in a queue, only to have the wifi bug out, a tab shut accidentally, or a distraction whisk you away. To get going again, customers have to start from the top, repeating themselves and wasting time.</p>

<h3>69% of US online adults use messaging to contact customer service</h3>

<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p>Messaging lets people chat back and forth without losing the conversation history and its context. This way, customers don’t have to repeat themselves, and agents get the context they need to address the issue and personalize the interaction. It’s no wonder messaging has the highest CSAT of any channel, quicker resolution, and wide adoption by brands people love.</p>
<h3>Messaging is more engaging and interactive</h3>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p> Social messaging apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook Messenger have spoiled people with rich features: Quick replies, auto responses, carousels, typing indicators and read receipts make it easier for companies who use messaging to understand and anticipate customers’ needs.</p>
<p>These are the sorts of conversational experiences your customers have come to expect. By embedding messaging into your own websites and mobile apps, customers are treated to an experience akin to chatting with friends, family, and colleagues. Doesn’t that sound more comfortable?</p>
</p></div>

      </div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h2>Messaging makes support teams more efficient</h2>
<p>Let’s add a touch of realism here: While customers love being able to chat with companies, it’s probably not the only way they’re keeping in touch. With legacy channels like email and phone, or newer social channels, it may seem like support agents already have too much on their plates. Not so!</p>
<p>Throwing messaging into the mix, especially when it can be managed alongside conversations from other channels, actually reduces friction. Agents can multitask, work asynchronously, and keep multiple conversations afloat — without the pressure of balancing multiple live conversations.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p>When agents have all the context they need at their fingertips, they can deliver the best customer experience possible. Instead of managing each channel in a silo, or forgoing certain channels altogether, agents can be allocated where needed to manage and track conversations.</p>
<p>        <img class="lazyload no-src" alt="" data-src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/j/zendeskmessaging/Agent-and-enduser-sidebyside-image.png" /></p>
<p>Capturing customer context doesn&#8217;t have to be hard. All the information can be captured before the conversation even starts — with the help of a little automation. Messaging makes it possible for brands to automate routine interactions to save time and collect data. Features like embedded forms that allow for important data to be captured before anything is escalated to an agent.</p>
<p>Context is critical to a successful interaction and a satisfied customer. In a modern agent workspace, data like the customer’s name and contact info, as well as their interaction history is visible to agents and accessible to team members. This frees agents from asking routing questions, allowing them to think critically about the stuff that’s actually important, and focus on more complex queries.</p>
<h2>Messaging is easy to implement, customize, and scale</h2>
</p></div>

<h3>70% of customer interactions will involve emerging technologies such as machine learning, chatbots, and mobile messaging by 2022</h3>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/message/state-of-messaging-2020/">State of Messaging 2020</a></em></p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p>When a customer needs help outside of regular business hours, or has a question that can be resolved quickly, a bot is the first point of contact in the conversation. A bot can take down the customer’s info so the business can follow up later, or guide the customer through self-service. An agent doesn’t necessarily need to be present to answer questions like “what are your store hours?” or “what’s your address?”, but it’s a best practice to give customers the option of chatting with a person if they really need to.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h2 class="accent-underline">Bots are better</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3>They save time</h3>
<p>Bots save time for agents and customers by collecting information before escalating. Capturing data, like names and contact information, means the agent can add personal touches, while additional context can help them get to the root of the issue sooner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They help teams scale <em>and</em> reduce costs</h3>
<p>42 percent of customer service leaders expect requests to grow, but they can’t always expand headcount. Deflecting one-touch requests, routing queries to the appropriate agent, and responding to customers outside of business hours are all jobs a bot can do well. Let agents be agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They create personalized conversational experiences</h3>
<p>Bots help you meet the customer where they are, and where they need you to be. They don’t need time off to help customers navigate self-service, intake data, answer FAQs, or even learn on their own.</p>
<p>But if a bot isn’t what your customer needs, they should be able to speak to a person. A bot shouldn’t be a blocker — it should be built for the occasion.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p>From an operational perspective, chatbots might seem a bit scary. Historically, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and decision trees haven’t had the most accessible fields for somebody setting up a support solution — but that’s changing.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of chatbots. Simple bots can be built by basically anyone with click-to-configure decision trees. They work out-of-the-box, no coding needed, and are a great time saver for support teams. For less complex needs, a business shouldn’t need to involve a third party to build out a straightforward experience.</p>
<p>Businesses should customize the experience. Both to their own needs, and for their customers. When things get complicated, an integrated messaging platform can help.</p>

</p></div>
<h2>Messaging is a platform with endless customizable options</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of messaging is how flexible it is. When you need a sophisticated chatbot — for complex use cases that require integrations, and dealing with more complex queries, working with a partner is the way to go.</p>
<p>Zendesk works with numerous partners to create myriad chatbots and helpdesk integrations because customer experience isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of situation. A conversational agent workspace is cool, but the needs of online retailers are pretty different from the needs of hospitality. The local library doesn’t need the same integrations as a global appliance manufacturer — but anything is possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/embedded-messaging/">Embedded messaging solutions like Zendesk&#8217;s own</a> allow enterprises to embed modern, asynchronous, and customized messaging experiences into their own websites and mobile apps without being tied to a third-party platform such as Facebook. </p>

<blockquote><p>Outsourcing your customer messaging to a third-party property comes with trade-offs</aside>
</blockquote>
<p> Outsourcing your customer messaging to a third-party property like Facebook comes with trade-offs.  </p>
<p>Facebook controls the user experience and available messaging features and businesses have to follow <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy/policy-overview/">Facebook’s policies</a>. </p>
<p>That means businesses typically can’t: </p>
<ul>
<li>Receive payments (this feature is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/294045524131594">only for friends and family</a>). And in-chat conversion-to-purchase rate is <a href="https://smooch.io/rich-message-framework/">2.3 times higher</a> compared to a website&#8217;s or mobile app&#8217;s checkout page.</li>
<li>Proactively message users unless it’s sponsored. And 87 percent of customers want brands to proactively contact them for customer service issues, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-consumers-want-todays-companies-to-be-proactive-in-customer-service-222952311.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to one study</a>.</li>
<li>Respond to customers after a 24-hour window. Once the customer stops replying, that conversation–and relationship–is frozen in a channel the business doesn’t own.</li>
</ul>
<p>If businesses want full control over the customer messaging experience and treasure trove of data these conversations provide, they&#8217;ll need an embedded messaging solution like Zendesk&#8217;s own.</p>

<h2 id="Facebook Chat vs. Facebook Messenger">Is Facebook Chat and Messenger the same?</h2>
<p>“Facebook Chat” and “Facebook Messenger” are often used interchangeably, but there’s a difference between the two. </p>
<p><b>Facebook Messenger</b> is Facebook’s flagship messaging feature. With <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-hits-2-27-billion-monthly-active-users-earnings-stabilize-n926391?utm_campaign=Service%20Blog%20Emails%20-%20Daily&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_content=98998376&#038;utm_source=hs_email">over 2 billion</a> monthly users, Messenger places a business right next to its customer’s friends and family. From the customer’s perspective, this makes it an easy and a comfortable way to get support.  </p>
<p>You can think of <b>Facebook Chat</b> as Messenger deployed on a business’s website. </p>
<p>Customers can connect with brands while browsing the web with the same personalized and rich-media experience they get directly in Messenger. And with chat histories synchronized across the chat plugin, Messenger app, and messenger.com, customers benefit from a continuous experience across all Facebook channels.</p>
<h2 id="Facebook Chatbots">What a-bot Facebook chatbots?</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2019/10/25/ai-stats-news-us-consumers-interest-in-using-chatbots-to-interact-with-businesses-rise-to-62/?sh=1cce09833974">62 percent</a> of US consumers reporting that they like using chatbots to interact with businesses, companies are incorporating bots in their support strategies to deliver speedy support, around the clock. </p>
<p>In fact, Facebook said it had <a href="https://blog.messengerdevelopers.com/messenger-at-f8-2018-44010dc9d2ea">300,000 active Messenger bots</a>—and that was in 2018.</p>
<p>Examples include <a href="https://withplum.com/">Plum</a>, a Facebook chatbot that sends users personalized savings advice, and <a href="https://www.multivu.com/players/English/7926152-sephora-messenger-beauty-tools/">Sephora’s virtual artist</a> that helps customers find the perfect lipstick shade.</p>
<blockquote><p>62 percent of consumers say they like using chatbots to interact with businesses</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16856654/facebook-m-shutdown-bots-ai">Facebook’s original out-of-the-box chatbot</a>, M, didn&#8217;t make sense for customers. But M lives on through Messenger’s low-maintenance, easy-to-program conversation flows. </p>
<p>To build the kinds of next-generation Facebook chatbot experiences that make customers’ and agents’ lives easier, a business will need to find the right bot partner to provide the infrastructure on the back end and the right interface to manage conversations on the front end.  </p>
<p>With <a href="https://smooch.io/">Zendesk’s Sunshine Conversations</a> or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/chatbot/">our chatbot marketplace</a>, organizations can build rich, personalized chatbot experiences across Facebook Messenger, Facebook Chat—or any channel.

<h2 id="Facebook Customer Chat benefits">Top Facebook Customer Chat benefits</h2>
<h3>More convenience for customers and agents than traditional live chat</h3>
<p>Like live chat, Facebook Chat enables customers to connect with brands as soon as they need help. And over 40 percent of customers consider 24/7 support, in real-time, a component of a good customer experience, according to our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">2020 Trends Report</a>. </p>
<p>But the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/difference-chat-messaging/">difference between live chat and messaging</a> is that live chat is session-based and synchronous. When a customer ends the conversation, the conversational history usually vanishes.</p>
<p>Facebook Chat, like any embedded messaging solution, is sessionless. This means customers can respond to messages at their own pace and agents can help more customers at once. Conversations can occur in real-time, but customers can also stop and start conversations when convenient. </p>
<p>In other words, Facebook Chat gives businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visibility into chat history: The Customer Chat plugin shows chat history between a customer and the business. </li>
<li>The ability to continue conversations: Businesses can follow up on customer conversations even after a customer abandons the chat, using the same conversation in Messenger. But unlike Zendesk messaging, the 24-hour rule still applies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A better e-commerce experience</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/3-ways-messaging-is-transforming-the-path-to-purchase">Eighty-three percent</a> of consumers message a business to ask about products or services. And when they do, 75 percent make a purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/online-retailers-transforming-customer-experience-conversational-commerce/">Conversational commerce</a> is the intersection between e-commerce and messaging. Facebook’s conversational commerce features make it a top channel for e-commerce companies. </p>

<h4>Click-to Messenger ads</h4>
</div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Businesses can encourage customers and prospects to message them with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/improve-click-to-messenger">targeted ads</a>. The CTA prompts people to message the company, automatically opening a chat when they click.</p>
<p>Businesses can also inspire customers to send messages organically with “Send Message” news feed posts. </p>

<h4>Sponsored messages</h4>
</p></div>

<p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/sponsored-messages/">Sponsored messages</a> allow businesses to retarget people who have previously messaged them with special promotions, offers, or updates inside the Messenger thread. </p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>With <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/27/facebook-60-million-businesses-have-pages-4-million-actively-advertise/">over 60 million</a> businesses on Facebook, customers are increasingly coming to Facebook to get support while discovering and purchasing products simultaneously.</p>
<p>That means businesses can no longer view a customer’s shopping experience and support experience in silos. Instead, they’ll need to view them as parts of a single, more holistic customer relationship.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>55 percent of online shoppers abandon a purchase because they can’t find an answer to a question quickly</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/forrester-proactive-chat/">55 percent</a> of online shoppers abandon a purchase because they can’t find an answer to a question quickly. With embedded messaging, businesses can get in front of those missed opportunities for conversation by making it effortless for customers to get support—so Talia doesn’t leave that puzzle in her cart behind because she’s wondering if it’s too hard for her 10-year-old.</p>
<p>By bringing over Messenger conversations, Facebook Chat also allows agents to see if a customer responded to a click-to-Messenger ad or a sponsored message, and use that as insight into what products they’re interested in and tailor responses accordingly. </p>
<p>Beyond ads and marketing-heavy content, brands can also build more organic conversational commerce experiences—if they have a <a href="https://smooch.io/">messaging platform like Sunshine</a>.</p>
<p>When customers reach out, businesses can provide immediate action opportunities inside the Messenger or Customer Chat thread with rich messaging types like carousels, forms, and picklists that feel less sales-focused and more relevant to what the customer is currently asking. </p>
<p>Suppose Steve messages Dream Hotels about honeymoon suite prices. He could have the option to select his hotel preferences, book his stay, and upgrade to a room with a view, within the messaging conversation. </p>
<p>If Sally messages Comfy Shoes regarding the fit of a pair of slippers, the conversation could automatically populate with details on the fit, relevant promotions, and the option to add the shoes in her size to her cart. </p>
<h2 id="Businesses need a more advanced inbox">The case for a more advanced inbox</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-facebook-business-suite">Facebook’s Business Suite</a> helps small businesses manage customer comments and messages across Messenger and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/instagram-for-business/">Instagram</a> from a unified inbox.</p>
<p>Teams using Business Suite must manage conversations from other channels, like WhatsApp, email, or voice, in a separate workspace—which is why Facebook doesn’t market its inbox to enterprise or midsize businesses. </p>
<p>Instead, businesses with higher volumes of customer requests can use Facebook’s Business APIs to integrate conversations with a CRM software like Zendesk.</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p>Businesses that connect Facebook Messenger to Zendesk can:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Turn conversations into support tickets and reply to messages sent to Customer Chat widgets in the same place they manage all channels</li>
<li>Track, manage, and prioritize conversations at scale with advanced tools like triggers, automations, and workflows</li>

<h2 id="Facebook Chat best practices">Facebook Chat best practices</h2>
<p>For businesses taking advantage of Facebook’s Business APIs, here are 5 best practices for managing Facebook Chat conversations.</p>
<p><img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/Facebook-Chat.png" alt="Facebook Chat" /></p>
<h3>1. Respond to customers quickly</h3>
<p>60 percent of customers consider quick resolutions the top indicator of a good customer experience, according to our 2020 Trends Report. </p>
<p>Facebook Chat is asynchronous, still, the need for speed remains crucial. </p>
<p>If a customer with a loaded shopping cart reaches out over Facebook Chat, a delayed response risks them abandoning their cart. In fact, 15 percent of customers expect a brand to respond to their chat in less than 5 minutes, and over 40 percent expect a response in less than an hour, our Trends Report also revealed.  </p>
<p>Facebook even rewards speedy support teams by tagging the business’s Facebook page as “Very Responsive.” Fast companies get a chat window on their page prompting users to send a message. </p>
<blockquote><p>60 percent of customers consider quick resolutions the top indicator of a good customer experience</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet many support teams lack the workspace to provide this speed. </p>
<p>A conversational interface like Zendesk’s Agent Workspace arms agents with tools for speedy replies, such as real-time notifications to indicate when a customer views a message. If Cindy leaves for a walk and then picks the conversation back up when she gets back from the park, an agent will be notified that she’s ready to talk again. </p>
<p>Businesses can also increase first-response time by having a chatbot start conversations on an agent’s behalf. </p>
<p>Chatbots can gather preliminary context, like what product a customer is inquiring about or what steps they’ve already tried to resolve their issue, so that the next available agent can solve the inquiry faster. </p>
<h3>2. Improve the agents experience with advanced tools </h3>
<p>Businesses also struggle with speed because agents don’t have advanced tools. </p>
<p>With triggers, automation, and workflows, support teams can increase agent efficiency and streamline conversation management. They can automatically assign things like:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>A high priority to loyal customers and route them to a VIP service team or flag they’re ticket as a priority in the queue</li>
<li>A repeat dissatisfied customer to a specialized support team–by looking at context, sentiment, and intent</li>
<li>Incoming messaging conversations to agents who are online and not at capacity, eliminating the need for triaging</li>
<li>Tickets to agents <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/skills-based-routing/">based on expertise</a>, like product focus or language</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses can also improve the agent experience with advanced collaboration tools. A support team might integrate their ticketing software with other internal tools like email and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/slack-customer-experience/">Slack</a> to share best practices across departments.</p>
<h3>3. Enable agents to bring in other channels when they need to</h3>
<p>High performing customer experience teams are more likely to have an omnichannel strategy in place, according to a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/cx-champion-maturity-report/">joint study by Zendesk and ESG</a>. They provide a mix of traditional channels like email and the phone and emerging channels like an AI-based help center, messaging apps, and SMS.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/omnichannel-really-means/">omnichannel means</a> more than just offering multiple channels. </p>
<p>Omnichannel experiences connect conversations across channels so agents can seamlessly toggle between channels and quickly switch channels when they need to. </p>
<p>An agent helping Sam return her blender might need to follow up on the Facebook Chat conversation with an email if she requests an email receipt. </p>
<p>With the Agent Workspace, both agents and customers can seamlessly channel-switch based on situation and customer preference without ending the conversation. Agents don’t have to respond to conversations on other channels using a different workspace, which means they can balance more customers at a time.</p>
<h3>4. Enrich conversations with interactive and customizable features</h3>
<p>Facebook Messenger comes with out-of-the-box features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIFS</li>
<li>Stickers</li>
<li>3D animations</li>
<li>Audio recordings</li>
<li>Quick replies</li>
<li>Automated responses</li>
<li>Away messages to notify customers when agents are off the clock</li>
<li>Appointment reminders for customers who booked an appointment on the company’s Facebook Page</li>
</ul>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>Businesses can further enhance conversations with more interactive and customizable features—but they’ll need the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sunshine-technical-guide/">messaging platform</a> to provide the infrastructure. </p>
<p>With a CRM platform like Sunshine, businesses can enable customers to make reservations, complete forms, select preferences from a pick list, and more inside the thread.
  </p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>Taking it a step further, a robust messaging platform can enable businesses to deploy the same rich experience across any messaging channel, whether that’s Facebook Chat, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, or SMS.</p>
<p>Sunshine Conversations enables a business to build once and deploy anywhere—in other words; deploy the same or best version of a rich messaging experience across channels, even those that don’t offer that experience natively. </p>
<h3>5. Arm agents with context for greater personalization</h3>
<p>A customer’s Messenger context card includes basic details such as a customer’s location and local time, which helps for questions about things like opening hours.</p>
<p>But customers expect personalization beyond the most basic. In fact, 76 percent of customers surveyed in our Trends Report expect personalization, including engagement over their preferred contact method, account type or status, and recommendations based on purchase or search history.</p>
<p>To provide this level of personalization, agents need insight that exceeds a customer’s identity. </p>
<p>Context into a customer’s purchase history and preferences is key to Customer Chat and Messenger since customers use Facebook to shop for products. And 91 percent of consumers say they’re more likely to shop with brands who recognize, remember, and provide them with relevant offers and recommendations, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/why-messaging-businesses-is-the-new-normal">according to Facebook</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p> 91 percent of consumers say they’re more likely to shop with brands who recognize, remember, and provide them with relevant offers and recommendations</p></blockquote>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p>With Facebook’s Business APIs, companies can integrate support conversations into a CRM to create a 360 customer view. A CRM like Zendesk Sunshine can give agents—<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/context-leads-better-chatbots-better-conversation/">and chatbots</a>—access to: </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Context coming from other tools, such as a marketing automation software or payment processor like Stripe</li>
<li>What’s in a customer’s shopping cart </li>
<li>Discount offers a customer qualifies for and what offers they’ve already used or the marketing team recently sent </li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>With this kind of context, agents can deliver more tailored responses and create personalized experiences that drive loyalty. </p>
<h2>Build better customer relationships with embedded messaging</h2>
<p>The move towards messaging is a trend that’s expected to stick around for the long haul, according to <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/customer-service-predictions-2021/">Forrester’s 2021 predictions</a>. Businesses swapping live chat with embedded messaging are ahead of the game. </p>
<p>Similar to Facebook friends, communicating with businesses should feel effortless, convenient, and personal. That’s the kind of support that builds lasting customer relationships—and just like loyal friends, loyal customers are gold. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever feel like you&#8217;re running several different companies within your sales team?</p>
<p>Jane, your top seller, has one strategy for gaining leads and closing deals, while Joe, your second-in-command, has another. Both methods work, but the steps to get there are so different that switching back and forth from one process to the other feels like whiplash. And there&rsquo;s a reason for that: the &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; sales process doesn&rsquo;t work for a growing organization.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry; there&rsquo;s a simple solution.</p>
<p>Sales process mapping is the secret to solving these headaches. It&rsquo;s a visual way of laying out the sales life-cycle stages that gives you a macro view of the process. It is also a way to make sure your whole team follows the same steps to convert prospects into customers.</p>
<h2>Sales process mapping shows you the macro view</h2>
<p>Sales process mapping reformats your sales steps into &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some maps are linear, with steps that build on each other</li>
<li>Others are flowcharts or decision trees that give you different steps based on the customer&rsquo;s preferences or decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, mapping provides a clear, actionable path to move prospects forward in the sales process.</p>
<p>With this high-level view, you can zoom out and see how close leads are to converting. Or you can see which steps are causing hang-ups for your team and need more attention.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a lead that seems &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in the sales process. Even with your team&rsquo;s best efforts, you&rsquo;re no closer to closing the deal. With a process map, you can go through and cross off every step they&rsquo;ve already completed and then drill down to the next step required to get them moving again. Then, you can dig into their current stage and the next step to figure out what the essence of the sticking point is.</p>
<h2>Sales process mapping is a way to solve pain points</h2>
<p>The upside to sales process mapping is that it gives you a big-picture view of every step in your sales life cycle. The downside? The maps are, well, <em>big</em>. They show you a lot of information all at once.</p>
<p>Avoid overloading your brain by focusing on the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve, not the entire map.</p>
<h3>Pain point: no clear person in charge of each step</h3>
<p>If your team struggles with assigning the right people to each step, sales process mapping can help. Use a map&rsquo;s big-picture view to define what each step includes and who&rsquo;s the right person to get it done.</p>
<p>Start by grouping steps into buckets, and list the activities associated with each one.</p>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s an</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.slideteam.net/sales-process-map-ppt-visual-aids-example-file.html"><em>example</em></a><em> of a sales process map that clearly lists the team responsible for the step and the supporting leads.</em></p>
<p>From there, note on the map which types of roles will be responsible for each stage&rsquo;s tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business development reps:</strong> Use these team members for lead generation, market research, relationship-building, and PR opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Sales agent:</strong> Assign your sales reps to make cold calls and determine top-of-funnel interest. If you have reps who are especially gifted in closing deals, make them your &ldquo;closers.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Closers:</strong> Use these powerhouse dealmakers to do advanced research on hot prospects&rsquo; business needs and pitch your detailed sales presentations.</li>
<li><strong>Executive team:</strong> Bring your leaders in at the final step to sign contracts and arrange payment.</li>
<li><strong>Customer success reps:</strong> Once the new customer is acquired, turn their account management over to a customer success rep for long-term support.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assignments on the map should help you visualize the work distribution so you can even it out and avoid overloading employees.</p>
<h3>Pain point: inefficient process steps</h3>
<p>Representing your sales process in a visual map makes it easy to see where your team is getting bogged down and what the underlying issues might be.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your sales team successfully generates leads, but prospects rarely reach the negotiation stage. You take a look at your map and see that it doesn&rsquo;t have many activities for nurturing leads. You add in several tasks&mdash;send personalized emails, follow up with relevant content, ask for customer feedback&mdash;so reps know how they&rsquo;re expected to build prospects&rsquo; interest.</p>
<p>Or maybe your map shows you that the same team member is responsible for too many areas of the sales map. Overusing the same person in multiple process steps can lead to tasks falling through the cracks. Prioritize that teammate&rsquo;s strongest skill set, and make that their focus. Divide up their remaining responsibilities to other team members.</p>
<p>No matter what the stumbling blocks are, process mapping can make problems much clearer than simply listing out the steps.</p>
<h3>Pain point: sales team lacks motivation or direction</h3>
<p>Process mapping shows your team the bird&rsquo;s-eye view, so they can see how their work ties into the ultimate goal of turning leads into customers.</p>
<p>It gives your sales team the confidence to understand their role in the life cycle and to see what it will take to move leads forward. The chart also makes seeing the mile markers of success easy. Having a goal to reach&mdash;to be able to move a prospect from one step of the map to the next&mdash;gives your team an objective to focus on, increasing motivation.</p>
<p>A sales process map will likely decrease the time it takes to convert a prospect into a customer because the steps forward are clearly defined. As a result, you&rsquo;ll see a boost in revenue. In fact, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/sales-process/">79% of the highest-performing companies</a> surveyed in a recent study said they use a unified sales process.</p>
<h2>Visualize your goals with sales process mapping</h2>
<p>Sales process maps are a powerful way to lay out your strategy and organize your team around your goals. But they aren&rsquo;t static documents. The necessary tactics for moving customers through your steps will change based on their needs.</p>
<p>For that reason, knowing as much as you can about your customers before you build your map is critical. Check out the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2020</a> to learn what today&rsquo;s customers expect of your business. Then, use what you learn to build a sales process map focused on your customers&rsquo; needs.</p>

<p>With today&rsquo;s modern technology, you can track pretty much anything about your sales performance. But just gathering data isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>To make the most of your data, you need to strategically choose the metrics you want to track and how often you want to track them. Taking this intentional approach, you&rsquo;ll have meaningful information to pull insights from&mdash;not an overwhelming pile of data.</p>

<h2 align="center">What are sales performance metrics?</h2>
<p>Sales performance metrics are measurements that help you gauge the effectiveness of your agents, your systems, and your sales strategy.</p>
<p>You can use sales performance metrics to measure your team&rsquo;s short-term progress toward sales goals or to gauge improvement opportunities for individual team members. Some metrics can even measure long-term objectives, like whether your sales strategy is working.</p>
</p></div>
</section>
<section>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>The key to using sales performance metrics is tracking them consistently at an appropriate cadence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some metrics will give you almost no information if you look at them over a week but are very valuable when zoomed out to look over several months</li>
<li>Other metrics give you the best information when you evaluate them weekly</li>
</ul>
<p>In this guide, you&rsquo;ll learn about ten metrics that can help you better understand your sales performance.</p>

<p>Setting weekly metrics gives your team a micro view of their performance, so they can regularly assess their areas of improvement.</p>
<p>A weekly report shows them just five days&rsquo; worth of activity, so they can break their goals up and look for short-term improvement opportunities. Zooming in on the sales process like this helps reps set mini goals to reach throughout the week.</p>

<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The number of calls, emails, and live chats your reps initiate within a week.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>Use contact volume to understand your sales reps&rsquo; current capacity and set weekly goals.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>Choose a weekly contact goal for your team based on the average contact volumes in past successful weeks. Be sure not to set this goal too high&mdash;if reps feel pressured to meet a lofty contact goal, the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/6-metrics-that-will-change-your-sales-teams-behavior/">quality of their conversations</a> may drop.</p>

<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The percentage of unique contacts made that ended in an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>It shows you your reps&rsquo; ability to convert cold prospects into warm leads, effectively moving your prospects down the sales pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use this metric to gauge employee performance. Instead, use it to make sure you have the right people in the right stage of the sales funnel. Position reps with consistently high appointment setting percentages at the beginning of the sales cycle to capitalize on their talents.</p>

<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The length of time (typically measured in minutes) it takes reps to make contact with generated leads.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>Lead response time tells you whether your reps are reacting with urgency so leads don&rsquo;t get away. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.drift.com/blog/lead-response-survey/">Studies show</a> a rep needs to respond to a lead in five minutes or less. Otherwise, the possibility of conversion drops significantly.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>Use this metric to ensure your team is consistently responding below the five-minute window.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t, take a look at what factors may be preventing them from answering quickly. Maybe they&rsquo;re overwhelmed with their current leads, and you need to hire more staff. Or maybe the sales technology you&rsquo;re using is out-of-date, and it&rsquo;s slowing the process down.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="container">

<p>It&rsquo;s common for the sales process to take over a week to complete. Monthly metrics cover a wide enough time range to measure completed cycles, not just initial contact.</p>

<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The amount of monthly leads marketing has determined as &ldquo;quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>Your number of MQLs is a starting point to gauge whether you&rsquo;ve sourced enough good leads for your sales team to act on.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to understand if your MQLs are really good candidates for sales is to look at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/">conversion rates from MQL to sales qualified leads (SQLs)</a>. The higher the conversion rate, the higher quality your MQLs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re short on MQLs, consider increasing your marketing budget or using a lead generation tool like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/reach/">Sell Reach</a> to build up your list.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>BDR capacity is a formula that considers daily leads, how many reps you have, and how many work days are in the month to give you a total number of leads your business development team can source in a month.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>This metric, when compared to MQL targets, will tell you if your business development team is properly staffed or overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/13-important-sales-metrics/">Compare BDR capacity and MQLs.</a></p>
<p>If BDR capacity is greater than your monthly MQLs, your business development team should be able to take on more work.</p>

<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>AE capacity is the maximum number of deals your account execs can handle in a month.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>AE capacity helps you determine staffing and workload for your account executive team.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/13-important-sales-metrics/">Compare your monthly AE capacity to the number of monthly sales deals won.</a></p>
<p>If your AE capacity is greater than the number of deals won, you aren&rsquo;t using your account execs to their full potential. Think of ways to fill your pipeline or double down on prospecting.</p>
<p>If your AE capacity is less than the number of deals won, your account execs are working too hard. You need to hire a couple more AEs, or up the requirements for your BD team to pass prospects along.</p>

<div class="col col-small-8">
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>A ratio of how many deals you won out of how many you attempted to win.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>Win rate is a quick way to gauge how effective your sales techniques are. It can shed light on whether your reps are succeeding or need more support.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>Segment your win rate by industry, channel, size, or by each rep or team of reps to look at how it changes based on the group.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, what qualifies as a &ldquo;good&rdquo; win rate depends on a lot of factors, like your customer base and the product being sold. Look at previous monthly win rate averages for a baseline, and strive to outperform your past months. You can also use win rate as a metric for friendly competitions between sales teams, with monthly incentives to outperform other groups.</p>

<p>A ratio that takes your expenses and number of new customers into account to determine how much it costs your business (in dollars) to win one customer.</p>

<p>It helps you look at how best to invest your sales and marketing budget, based on which customer segments are the most expensive and valuable.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>A ratio of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to sales and marketing expenses to measure the efficiency of subscription-based business models.</p>
<p><strong>Why measure it?</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; metric is a way for SaaS and other subscription-based services to determine how efficient their spending is.</p>
<p>Subscription-based services can make calculating revenue and expenses hard. You have to make an upfront investment, and your profit then trickles in over a period of months, so identifying if your strategies are working isn&rsquo;t very straightforward.</p>
<p>The magic number helps you put a value on whether your sales and marketing investments will yield the profits you expect.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use it?</strong></p>
<p>Use the magic number in annual and quarterly business planning to gauge whether your go-to-market approach is working.</p>
<p>You want your magic number to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tonyfedorov.com/saas-magic-number/">0.75 or higher</a>. If it&rsquo;s below 0.75, revisit your CAC&mdash;they&rsquo;re probably too high. If it&rsquo;s more than 1, you may want to spend more money on sales and marketing to support your growing revenues.</p>
<p>The magic number is vital for subscription-based SaaS companies. But getting the right values to plug into the formula can take some teamwork.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may think that &ldquo;Mayochup&rdquo; is a great topping for fries, an abominable Frankenstein&rsquo;s condiment, or just a hilarious example of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRntutn8udw">&rsquo;90s satire</a> predicting the future.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal preference, though, there&rsquo;s no denying that it represents a huge <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://shortyawards.com/11th/mayochup">social listening triumph</a> for Kraft Heinz.</p>
<p>The polarizing combination of ketchup and mayonnaise was originally sold only in the Middle East. But when folks in the United Kingdom found out about it, they started debating the sauce&rsquo;s merits on social media. Once Heinz got wind of the conversation, they recognized that Mayochup might deserve a wider audience.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Mayochup tweet" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/social-listening-mayochup-tweet.png" /></p>
<p>The company posted a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/HeinzKetchup_US/status/984133260216332302">Twitter poll</a> asking American customers whether they wanted the item available in stores. Not only did Mayochup edge out a victory, but the poll itself earned over 300 million impressions across various social platforms.</p>
<p>The campaign confirmed that customers were interested in a new product and helped spread awareness of Heinz&rsquo;s recently launched mayo.</p>
<p>Diving deep into Twitter interactions won&rsquo;t always yield such delicious results. But social listening can be a powerful tool for understanding both what&rsquo;s being said about your brand and how to contribute to the conversation.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is social listening?</h2>
<p>Social listening is the process of tracking and analyzing social media mentions of your brand, products, competitors, and industry.</p>
<p>The goal of social listening is to gain actionable insights into your consumer base and their perceptions of your business.</p>
</div>
<p>In practical terms, it&rsquo;s keeping a pulse on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and every other social channel your leads and customers may use. And it&rsquo;s not just about checking your brand&rsquo;s own posts and mentions. Social listening means keeping your ears open for every conversation that pertains to your business.</p>
<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between social listening and social monitoring?</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes the terms &ldquo;social listening&rdquo; and &ldquo;social monitoring&rdquo; are used interchangeably. But while monitoring tracks conversations about your business, listening digs deeper to diagnose the sentiment behind those conversations.</p>
<p>Social monitoring tells you the &ldquo;what,&rdquo; while listening goes a step further to reveal the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of analyzing conversations for the specific actions taken within them, you&rsquo;re analyzing the conversation for meaning,&rdquo; explains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelsamuels/">Rachael Samuels</a>, social media manager for the social management platform <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sproutsocial.com/">Sprout Social</a>. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s much more qualitative and much more broad, and it allows you to be a lot more proactive instead of reactive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monitoring shows you the symptoms, but listening provides the insights you need to treat the underlying causes. And it does that in part by casting a wider net and tracking conversations about your competitors and your industry at large.</p>
<p>So instead of just monitoring how 25 of your brand&rsquo;s own posts are performing, you might look at hundreds of posts on a relevant topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social listening is not just listening to what&rsquo;s happening to your brand, but listening to what&rsquo;s happening in the world around your brand,&rdquo; Rachael says.</p>
<h2>Why is social listening important?</h2>
<p>Social listening can be used to uncover perceptions and attitudes critical to a brand&rsquo;s marketing and sales decisions. It&rsquo;s also a great way to surface information that can be used to improve your products and customer service.</p>
<p>Listening can tell you what your prospects and leads are talking about on social, revealing the best way to reach them. You can learn how customers search for products, what their pain points are, and why they might prefer your competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a while, Samsung was using listening to understand how to feature its target audiences and how to develop battle content to go against the iPhone,&rdquo; Rachael says. &ldquo;So they started just listening to see what people were saying about the content that was coming out from Apple and why it was resonating with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samsung found that customers really liked seeing the phone&rsquo;s camera capabilities, including its slo-motion video setting. In response, Samsung launched a video series campaign showing the Galaxy phone&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/989836564988444673">own slow-mo setting</a> in action.</p>

    Samsung has used social listening to find out what iPhone users dislike about their devices.
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the past, Samsung also used social listening to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pulsarplatform.com/blog/2014/the-samsung-vs-apple-court-case-shows-the-value-of-social-media-research/">find out</a> what iPhone users <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like about their devices. The company identified specific complaints, such as screen size and battery life, where Samsung phones had the edge on Apple. They then highlighted those advantages in campaigns that heavily promoted the key features.</p>
<p>Social listening also helps customer service teams learn about product issues, which they can quickly address to mitigate the fallout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-through-social-media/">One in every three customers</a> has used social media to ask for advice or communicate with a brand. Companies can analyze conversations happening around their products to uncover recurring issues.</p>
<p>When a beverage manufacturer created a topic on brand awareness, they noticed people using the word &ldquo;glass&rdquo; in product mentions. Looking closer, they found complaints that pieces of glass were being found in some of their bottles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once they found out that theme was bubbling up, they were able to narrow down the timeframe of those conversations,&rdquo; Rachael says. &ldquo;Specifically, they were able to see what shipments were affected, and how many people were reached by the tweets that were sent by other people. So they were able to address that issue head-on and make things right with their customers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>How to get started with social listening tools</h2>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re <em>extremely online</em>, you probably don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to search every social media channel for every keyword related to your brand.</p>
<p>Fortunately, social listening tools like Sprout Social can automatically track all relevant conversations and surface specific trends and interactions.</p>
<p>To start listening, you&rsquo;ll want to set your software to track relevant topics and keywords on social media platforms. That includes all mentions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your brand names, social media handles, and products</li>
<li>Your competitors&rsquo; brand names, handles, and products</li>
<li>Your slogans, branded hashtags, and campaign names</li>
<li>Your competitors&rsquo; slogans, branded hashtags, and campaign names</li>
<li>Industry-specific terms and hashtags</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to also track common misspellings of all the names, words, and phrases you want to monitor. You don&rsquo;t want to miss out on any insights just because some of your customers are prone to typos.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Social listening example - Sprout Coffee" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/social-listening-example-sprout-coffee.png" /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve set the channels and topics, your social listening tool should be able to report on key metrics for each one, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong> Number of posts about a topic</li>
<li><strong>Potential impressions:</strong> Number of times a topic was displayed</li>
<li><strong>Total engagements:</strong> Number of people interacting with a post</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> Percentage of mentions that are positive versus negative</li>
<li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Profile names, user devices, and geographic location of those participating in the conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to offer better customer service if you integrate your social listening tool and customer support platform. Once the two are connected, social media managers can identify support issues and share them with the customer service team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of social listening tools, ours included, allow you to task things over to someone else in your organization or delegate messages in apps,&rdquo; explains Rachael. &ldquo;So we have the option to task something over as a support issue or flag it as an issue we might need to be prepared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/#features">Zendesk Support</a> features <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/sprout-social/">a Sprout Social integration</a> that makes this kind of collaboration possible. The software enables customer service teams and social media managers to create and share support tickets in social media channels. It also makes it easy to send messages between Sprout Social and Zendesk, track assigned tasks, and serve customers more quickly.</p>
<h2>Listening more closely in an ever-changing world</h2>
<p>In an increasingly unpredictable landscape, brands are recognizing the need for agility. With social listening, you can see how customer preferences are shifting in real time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re forced to pivot and have to be agile, you may think, &lsquo;how can I get quick, easy, simple access to a focus group?&rsquo;&rdquo; Rachael says. &ldquo;And social&rsquo;s right there for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more insights you can glean from social media, the better you can serve your customers. To start improving CX today, try a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/register/">free trial of Zendesk</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How to pick customer segmentation software that will scale with your team</h1>
<h2>What to look for in a segmentation tool</h2>
<p>Customer segmentation involves classifying customer data by specific traits to learn more about the groups that make up your customer base. The more you understand them, the better you can serve them.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to segment customers &#8211; by age, location, occupation, account type, company size, and more. Unless you&rsquo;re prepared to keep a few thousand Post-it notes on hand at all times, you&rsquo;ll need a sophisticated software solution for capturing and analyzing all that data.</p>
<p>Selecting the right customer segmentation tools requires careful consideration of a few factors. Before committing to a solution, make sure you know what the platform is measuring and how easy it is to customize, visualize, and scale that data.</p>
<h2>Start with a powerful CRM for capturing customer data</h2>
<p>Before you can begin segmenting anything, you need to have all of your customer data gathered together in one place. According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgforbes/">Andrew Forbes</a>, Zendesk&rsquo;s Group Manager of Product Marketing, customer segmentation works only if you have a &ldquo;master record&rdquo; of all customer characteristics and interactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This usually includes billing or subscription information, firmographic information, and other relationship-related metrics,&rdquo; Andrew says.</p>
<p>Your company probably has all of that information on file, so to speak &#8211; but those files might not all be in the same filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Perhaps your customer&rsquo;s average annual revenue is known only to your sales or billing department. Meanwhile, their history of support interactions is known only to your customer service team. That sort of siloing makes it hard for your customer support agents and sales reps to fully understand the context of the customer they&rsquo;re dealing with. And it makes it pretty much impossible to create customer segments for marketing or customer service analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re helping businesses solve this challenge with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/platform/features/#features">our Sunshine platform</a>, which enables you to create a unified picture of who your customers are and how they engage with your business,&rdquo; Andrew says.</p>
<p>The Sunshine customer relationship management (CRM) system has four key components that it tracks in order to provide comprehensive customer context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified customer profiles:</strong> Bring together all of the data available about a customer, including info taken from third-party apps like LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom events:</strong> Automatically document every interaction a customer has with your brand, from mobile activity to virtual shopping carts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom objects: </strong>Store and easily access all of the customer&rsquo;s products and past orders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversations:</strong> View customer conversations across every channel, from phone calls to live chat to social messaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you use Sunshine or another platform, it&rsquo;s critical that your CRM document all customer details, conversations, interactions, and purchases. The more variables you track, the more ways you&rsquo;ll be able to segment customers.</p>
<h2>Integrate customer segmentation software to fully leverage your customer data</h2>
<p>All of the customer data in the world won&rsquo;t do you much good if you can&rsquo;t dig deep into it. If a key performance indicator is shifting, you won&rsquo;t really know why until you break down the numbers to see who&rsquo;s driving it.</p>
<p>Make the most of the info in your CRM by integrating customer segmentation software that has three key qualities: customizability, visibility, and scalability.</p>
<h3>Customizability</h3>
<p>When customer satisfaction lags, you know something is wrong. But <em>what</em>, exactly? Segmentation tools make it easier to carve into that KPI and pull out an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When looking at tools and features, it&rsquo;s all about customization,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;The ability to slice and dice your data in a variety of different ways being most critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If customer satisfaction is dropping, assess this metric across different segments. Are customers who own one product less satisfied than others? Are people calling customer support more frustrated than those interacting with answer bots? Do customers in specific age groups, subscription plans, or loyalty programs like your brand better than other brands?</p>
<p>Find customer segmentation software that lets you play with the data to your heart&rsquo;s content. With Zendesk&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-segmentation-analytics/">customer segmentation tool</a>, you can monitor and analyze metrics, enabling you to fully leverage all the info in your CRM.</p>
<p>Our Sunshine CRM captures customer segments in custom organization fields. When you integrate it with Zendesk, you&rsquo;re then able to segment KPIs like CSAT, first reply time, Net Promoter Score, and many others.</p>
<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important for the segmentation tool to provide a clear way to visualize all of the information. The more numbers you&rsquo;re dealing with, the easier it is to get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, looking at data in a spreadsheet is fine, but the data can often become stale or hard to read,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;When looking for a solution, look for tools that allow your business to build dynamic charts that update as data comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our customer segmentation tool features over 20 chart types and comes with a feature that recommends certain graphs based on the type of data you&rsquo;re measuring. It also lets you incorporate those charts into pre-built or custom dashboards that you can use to keep tabs on specific customer segments and KPIs.</p>
<p>These dashboards automatically update as new data comes in. And they can be quickly shared with colleagues so they have a better picture of what matters, too. You can even schedule reporting so that your coworkers get weekly updates on whatever segment you&rsquo;re monitoring.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>You want customer segmentation software that&rsquo;s simple to use but sophisticated enough to scale with your organization. Businesses need to grow, and your segmentation tool needs to keep up.</p>
<p>The software solution you choose should start measuring table-stakes metrics the moment you start it up. But it should also give you the ability to do more niche reporting as your company expands and starts monitoring more distinctive segments.</p>
<p>Zendesk has that one-size-fits-all design. Intuitive pre-built dashboards make it easy to start using the software right away. But you can also custom-build more complex dashboards to match your company&rsquo;s ever-expanding needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we built the product, we spent a lot of time to ensure we could help customers at all stages,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we provide a range of functionality that caters to different companies and segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zendesk is also built on a modern, well-supported infrastructure that gives businesses ample flexibility and speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teams don&rsquo;t need to spend hours shaping their data for reporting,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already done that work, making it possible for businesses to start analyzing their data immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Customer segmentation tools that can keep up with your team</h2>
<p>Your CRM and customer segmentation software should help you collect more data and wring more meaningful insights out of it. And it should give you more time to act on those revelations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Zendesk, teams don&rsquo;t need to spend hours shaping their data for reporting,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already done that work for them, making it possible for businesses to start analyzing their data immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In construction, it&#8217;s impossible to erect a building if you don&#8217;t have one critical document — a blueprint. Steel frames, power tools, and a team of builders are all important elements, but they’re useless if you don’t have a document to guide the process.</p>
<p>Like a blueprint is essential for constructing buildings, you need a strategy as a manager to build a successful sales department — a step-by-step plan to help you and your team drive company revenue. In this post, we&#8217;ll break down what a sales strategy actually is and how you can create your own. </p>

<h2>What is a sales strategy?</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<p>A sales strategy is a detailed written plan on how your team will target customers to sell more products. It shows your desired sales goals and details how operations will be carried out to meet these objectives.</p>
<p>Instead of your team making decisions on the fly, a sales strategy keeps everyone on task and the long-term vision in mind. It should be comprehensive, well-researched, and actionable for your sales team to work from. </p>

</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<p>Before you can effectively sell your product or service, you need a vision of what you’re trying to accomplish for your company.</p>
<p>This is where sales goals come in. They give direction to your entire sales strategy as a guiding light for your team to work towards.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to set realistic and achievable sales goals:</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<ul class="no-list-style">
<li>
<h3>Assess your company resources</h3>
<p>Before setting lofty sales goals, think about what resources your sales department has and how they could help or hinder your team from reaching their targets. Will you need to hire more salespeople? Do you have the tools, such as a CRM, to quickly move leads through the sales pipeline? Make sure your operations are positioned to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Review past sales’ customer data</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to create reasonable goals for the upcoming year. Maybe a significant amount of customers churned last year, so your goal is to improve retention. Use this data to determine goals that are both realistic and useful for your sales team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Use the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/setting-sales-goals/">S.M.A.R.T.</a> model</h3>
<p>Actionable goals are S.M.A.R.T.&mdash;specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Examples of S.M.A.R.T. goals could be “Increase deal size by 35% through upsells” or “Achieve $1 million in sales during 2020.”</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<p>Once your overall sales goals are set, work backwards. Set realistic short-term deadlines for the steps your sales department and reps must take to ensure that final goals are reached.</p>
<p>For example, if an overall sales goal is to “Increase customer retention rate by 50% during Q4,” a short-term team goal could be “Increase customer check-ins by 15% per month.”  Breaking down overall goals into smaller weekly or monthly objectives will make them feel more approachable for your team to complete. </p>
</p></div>
</p></div>

<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<h2 id="market-fit">2. Nail down your market fit</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Understanding how your brand fits in its market is essential in sales. If you can’t articulate your brand’s unique value, it’s unlikely that you can persuasively sell your product or service.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<h3>Conduct a SWOT analysis</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<p>One way to identify how you fit in your market is to create a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT</a> (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, &amp; Threats) analysis. This information will help you review your current market position.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1"></div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<p>Here are a few questions you might answer when following this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific need does our product/service solve in our target market?</li>
<li>What is our value proposition?</li>
<li>What internal and external obstacles for our sales department could stop us from achieving our goals?</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Use your SWOT analysis to understand what opportunities you can leverage and what threats might hinder your sales team from effectively selling your product or service in your target market. You also might complete a SWOT analysis for each one of your competitors. Review what they’re doing well (and not doing well) to identify opportunities where you can outperform.</p>

<div class="row">
<p>You understand your target market. Now break it down even further into buyer personas — fictitious profiles that give a picture of your ideal customer and why they want your product or service.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<p>A buyer persona should include the following information:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>A fictitious name and title such as “Dana Matthews, CPA”</li>
<li>The person&#8217;s industry, age, salary, and education</li>
<li>Their goals and challenges</li>

<p class="caption">[<a href="https://blog.alexa.com/10-buyer-persona-examples-help-create/">Source</a>]</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>To create buyer persona profiles, first divide your customers into <a href="https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/customer-segmentation">segments</a> based on shared characteristics. For example, you might group buyers by the industry they work in or where they live. For each of these segments, create a single <a href="https://www.sellbrite.com/blog/ecommerce-sellers-can-build-buyer-personas-connect-customers/">buyer </a><a href="https://www.sellbrite.com/blog/ecommerce-sellers-can-build-buyer-personas-connect-customers/">persona</a> profile with the details mentioned above.</p>
<p>Work closely with your marketing team on this project — after all, they’re also bringing in leads and need to be on the same page as to what constitutes qualified ones. Personas should be referred to regularly by sales reps and marketing team members to ensure that they’re prospecting the right people.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, you’ll know which customers are the most valuable to target, attract, and retain.</p>

<h2 id="improve-customer-journey">4. Identify opportunities for improvement in the customer journey</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>Look closely at how customers are currently moving from being prospects to making a purchase. If you understand this journey, you’re able to determine efficient ways to convert customers in the coming year.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to identify opportunities for improvements:</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-4">
<h3>Reach out to your current customers</h3>
<p>Ask them about their interactions with your brand and what they appreciated or disliked. Are reps pushing a sale or focused on the customer relationship? Do customers feel neglected after the sale has been made? Find this information through informal conversations or surveys.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-4">
<h3>Determine what drives (or hampers) purchases</h3>
<p>Ask current or even prospective customers about obstacles to purchase. Is budget a common factor? Or is your product difficult to understand? You might need to include more affordable package options or coach your reps in explaining how your product/service works.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-4">
<h3>Review your competitors’ customer journeys</h3>
<p>What methods are competitors using to capture their attention? What platforms do they use to nurture the customer relationship? Research their website content, social media platforms, and customer reviews. All of this information will help guide your own sales tactics.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>By knowing the specific journey that your customers are taking and what they like or dislike about the process, your sales team will be better equipped to serve them and achieve the company’s sales goals. </p>

<h2 id="outline-action-plan">5. Outline an action plan</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>You know what you want your reps to achieve — now help them get there. This is where an action plan within your sales strategy comes into play. To build this plan, use the research you completed in steps 2 through 4 to define the tasks reps need to follow to meet the goals you set in step 1.</p>
<p>The tasks that you outline for your reps are going to be unique to your team and the research you did prior to this step. With that said, here are a few examples of customer acquisition and retention tasks you might set for your team:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generate leads through social selling.</strong> Reach prospects by <a href="https://blog.getbase.com/the-best-social-selling-platforms-and-how-to-use-them">answering questions on Quora</a> or participate in LinkedIn groups related to your industry. Provide value on these platforms and build relationships with those you meet.</li>
<li><strong>Source leads from support ticket conversations.</strong> Source important leads that typically fall through the cracks by integrating support tickets within your CRM, so reps can see the questions customers are asking and determine who would benefit from your product/service.</li>
<li><strong>Go for the upsell.</strong> If your company is proving your value to customers, don’t be afraid to suggest an upgrade to the customer. Highlight the benefits that your product or service is already bringing to the table and how additional features could help.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for referrals from current customers.</strong> Reach out to current satisfied customers and ask if they would be willing to provide a referral. Target the top 20% of your customers and ask for an introduction to similar companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>By setting an action plan, you ensure that your entire team is on track to meet your company’s sales goals. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Messaging apps are becoming a key channel across <strong>every stage of the buyer journey.</strong> <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/message/state-of-messaging-2020/">Eighty-three percent of consumers</a> use messaging apps to learn about a company&rsquo;s products or services, 75% use the apps to make purchases, and 76% of consumers use messaging apps to contact support.</p>
<p>Why? Because messaging apps are convenient. Consumers already use the apps to chat with friends and family, and they don&rsquo;t have to wait for a live agent to get support. They can start a conversation, close the app, and come back to it later.</p>
<p>Messaging apps provide brands with a direct line to consumers and enable companies to provide the level of personalized service their customers expect. This trend of businesses using messaging to connect with customers is often called &ldquo;conversational commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>So why are so many brands getting it wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Many companies think conversational commerce means selling their products or services via messaging apps. But true conversational commerce is using messaging apps to create an <strong>ongoing</strong> conversation with consumers across the <strong>entire buyer journey.</strong></p>
<h2>1. You&rsquo;re not using the right channels</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to just offer <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/">chat</a> or messaging on your website. You need to<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/messaging-partner-guide/"> integrate with the third-party apps</a> your customers are <em>already </em>using.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/"><em>Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2020</em></a>, <strong>half of all consumers</strong> prefer to contact <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-skills/">customer service</a> over the same channels they&rsquo;re using to talk to friends and family.</p>
<p>Start by asking your customers which messaging apps they prefer. SimilarWeb found that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/mobile-messaging-app-map-january-2019/">90% of smartphone users</a> in South Korea use the Kakoatalk messaging app. In India, 94.8% of Android owners prefer WhatsApp. Facebook Messenger is the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/message/state-of-messaging-2020/#chapter-1">second most popular messaging app</a> worldwide, predominantly used in the United States.</p>
<p align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/message/state-of-messaging-2020">Download the State of Messaging 2020 report</a></p>

<p class="caption"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">Source: Statista</p>

<p class="caption"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/mobile-messaging-app-map-january-2019/">Source: SimilarWeb</a></p>
<p>If you want to succeed at conversational commerce, you need to meet customers where they already are. Integrate with the third-party apps that make the most sense for your customer base.</p>
<h2>2. You&rsquo;re managing apps in silos</h2>
<p>Ideally, you should be able to manage all messaging apps &mdash; and all your other channels, for that matter &mdash; from a single view. Otherwise, conversations become scattered and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: A customer purchases a wireless keyboard from your company. Three months later, the keyboard starts malfunctioning, so the customer messages your company on Facebook.</p>
<p>The support agent they&rsquo;re connected with says a replacement keyboard will be shipped out later that day.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, no keyboard. The customer visits your website and clicks on the live chat widget for support. They&rsquo;re connected with a different agent who has no idea what&rsquo;s going on. The customer has to repeat everything &mdash; what their initial problem was, who they talked to, what steps they&rsquo;ve already taken to troubleshoot the issue, and so on.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>The cost of siloed communications</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">According to surveyed consumers</a>, having to repeat themselves is one of the<strong> top three most frustrating aspects</strong> of a bad customer service experience.</p>
<p>If you manage communication channels in silos, you&rsquo;re going to lose customers. Period.</p>

</div>
<p>Conversational commerce is about creating an ongoing relationship with consumers throughout the <em>entire </em>customer journey. With a solution like Zendesk, teams can view every interaction a customer has with your brand &mdash; chat message or not &mdash; in a single view. You can even move a Facebook Messenger chat over to email with the simple click of a button.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Agent view" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/convcomm-agent-view.png" /></p>
<p>To keep conversations going, make sure your messaging apps seamlessly integrate with all of your other communication channels.</p>
<h2>3. You&rsquo;re focused only on the sale</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;commerce&rdquo; part of conversational commerce is a bit misleading. This isn&rsquo;t just about selling your products through a messaging app. If that&rsquo;s your only focus, you could end up losing your customers by making them feel undervalued.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
    Conversation commerce isn&#8217;t just about sales; it’s about the entire customer experience across sales, marketing, and support
  </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Remember: Conversational commerce spans the entire customer life cycle. It&rsquo;s not just about sales; it&rsquo;s about the entire customer experience across sales, marketing, support. Agents must be able to pick up a conversation with a customer, regardless of where and with whom it originated. To do this, they need access to full customer context and conversation history, no matter where those interactions took place.</p>
<p>With Zendesk, employees can see data like purchase history, previous conversations with sales and support, shipping info, and more. This data allows agents to provide a consistent, convenient, and personalized experience across the entire buyer journey.</p>
<h2>Upgrade the customer experience with conversational commerce</h2>
<p>Messaging apps can open a direct, ongoing conversation with your customers. They make it possible for customers to receive the convenient, highly personalized experience they want, on their own terms. But for conversational commerce to truly work, brands have to be able to deliver that experience throughout every stage of the customer journey.</p>
<p>Zendesk consolidates all your communications channels into a single view. Support agents have access to the customer context, integrations, and tools they need to maintain a long-lasting conversation with customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/2020-state-smb-sales/">96% of sales reps struggle</a> with some stage of the sales cycle. For the majority of them today, the biggest challenges occur at the early stages of the cycle (lead generation, sales outreach, and qualification).</p>
<p>Reps can spend hours sifting through inbound leads to filter out unqualified prospects. And even then, they might not have enough information to determine if a lead is truly qualified or not.</p>
<p>Not to mention, without a full-picture view of their prospects and customers, it’s nearly impossible to provide a hyper-personalized experience. This makes it difficult to establish meaningful relationships with prospects and, in turn, close deals.</p>
<p>Add time-consuming, repetitive tasks to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for frustration and inefficiency. What if a single tool could solve all of those challenges at once?</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing a new integration to our powerful sales CRM, Zendesk Sell: <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/">ActiveCampaign</a>. ActiveCampaign is a customer experience automation tool that puts data from marketing and support systems into the hands of sales reps. Together, these tools give reps a 360-degree view of their prospects and customers, making it easier to generate and qualify leads, deliver personalized customer experiences, and scale growth. Here is how <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.activecampaign.com/apps/zendesk-sell-integration&#038;sa=D&#038;ust=1603827893801000&#038;usg=AOvVaw1LFSX2DVOarA3iqNFeGPk4">Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign</a> can help your sales reps.</p>
<h2>1. Identify high-quality leads in less time</h2>
<p>Lead generation and qualification are two of the most challenging steps in the sales process, according to respondents in the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/2020-state-smb-sales/">2020 State of SMB Sales</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>36% of sales teams find lead generation challenging</li>
<li>28% struggle to connect with leads</li>
<li>46% of sales teams have difficulty qualifying leads</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone working in sales can relate to these statistics. Prospecting is tedious and can take hours of research. And even when you do identify a lead, it’s not always easy to find the right contact information—let alone actually connect with that person.</p>
<p>In the same report, “Contacts are less likely to respond to phone calls” was cited as a key challenge for sales reps. Today’s consumers prefer to communicate digitally, which makes it harder to connect with them. Emails can easily get lost in a lead’s inbox, go ignored, or get marked as spam.</p>
<p>Even worse, sales reps can spend weeks following up with a lead who was never qualified in the first place.</p>
<p>After all, marketing and sales teams don’t always have the same definition of “qualified.” 27% of sales reps are consistently given marketing inbound leads who were never going to buy in the first place, according to the 2020 State of SMB Sales report.</p>
<p><img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/company%20challenges.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The good news is, there’s a solution to all these challenges.</p>
<p>With the Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign integration, sales reps have an arsenal of information available to them at all times. ActiveCampaign, for example, gives sales reps complete visibility into how customers interact with their website.</p>
<p>Reps will know when and how many times a consumer visits the pricing page, whether or not a lead has finished a free trial, and more. Instead of searching for leads from scratch, reps can use marketing insights to identify and qualify leads who have already shown interest in their product or services.</p>
<p>And with Zendesk Sell, reps can assign lead scores to specific actions a lead might take on their website. This way, sales can set their own standard for what constitutes a qualified lead.</p>
<p>With access to detailed marketing insights like these, it’s easier than ever for reps to keep their pipelines full of high-quality, inbound leads.</p>
<h2>2. Create a more personalized customer experience</h2>
<p>76% of customers expect companies to deliver a personalized experience, according to the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/">2020 Customer Experience Trends Report</a>.</p>
<p>To meet this expectation, sales reps need to understand their prospects and customers, inside and out. They need to know what those people want, what their pain points are, and what channels they use to communicate, to name a few.</p>
<p><img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/Personalize.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The ActiveCampaign integration gives Zendesk Sell users a 360-degree view of their prospects and customers. The context this information provides allows them to deliver a hyper-personalized customer experience.</p>
<p>Zendesk Sell automatically records and stores a contact’s entire history with a company in one place: the contact’s profile page. Sales reps can view everything from conversation history with other sales reps to customer support inquiries to interactions with marketing campaigns on the website, and more.</p>
<p>Shay Howe, VP of Platform Strategy at ActiveCampaign, explains the importance of having this information readily available: “At the end of the day, that customer has one experience, be it with marketing, with sales, with product, service, or elsewhere [. . .]” Customers don’t want to feel like they’re being handed off from one team to the next. The context Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign provides helps reps understand how to make that customer’s experience coherent and personalized across the entire buyer journey.</p>
<p>Sales reps can use conversation and purchase history to offer new products they know that customers will be interested in. They’ll know what problems the prospect has faced in the past and which product benefits will align best with their priorities.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it’s easier for reps to build great relationships with consumers they understand on a personal level. And the better those relationships are, the more likely those customers will be to stick around for the long haul.</p>
<h2>3. Scale-up sales growth by automating time-consuming tasks</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/2020-state-smb-sales/">27% of sales reps</a> are frustrated with having to spend time on data-entry instead of selling. Every day, they can spend hours on tasks like updating customer profiles and deals, sending sales emails, and scheduling follow-up calls with leads.</p>
<p>The Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign integration automates these time-consuming processes so reps can spend more time closing deals.</p>
<p>For example, the tools will automatically update and create deals based on the interactions consumers have with your brand.</p>
<p>Anytime a lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>interacts with an ad campaign on your website,</li>
<li>signs up for a free trial,</li>
<li>signs up for your blog’s newsletter,</li>
<li>visits the pricing page, or</li>
<li>views knowledge base content,</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions are automatically recorded to a lead’s profile in Zendesk Sell. This eliminates manual data entry and saves reps time.</p>
<p>Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign can even automate sales outreach, such as sending an email or web chat to consumers who visit your pricing page more than five times in a week.</p>
<p>Automatic reminders keep leads from getting lost by notifying reps when it’s time to follow up. All in all, these automations keep reps accountable and help improve productivity and efficiency – without sacrificing extra time or resources.</p>
<h2>Crushing your sales goals has never been so easy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/2020-state-smb-sales/">97% of sales teams want more from their CRM</a>. With Zendesk Sell + ActiveCampaign, your team will have access to the insights, data, and customer experience automation they need to generate higher-quality leads in less time, build better relationships, and scale up their sales growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of startup leaders we surveyed for the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/campaign/startups-benchmark/">Startups CX Benchmark Report 2020</a> said they are actively looking for a customer service solution. </p>
<p>These are the top reasons they cited for needing customer service software:</p>
<ul>
<li>More customer inquiries</li>
<li>Increasing operating costs</li>
<li>New product or service launch</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these sounds like you, then read on for tips to help you find a solution that aligns with your goals, your culture, and of course, your budget.   </p>
<h2>Customer service software features ranked by startups</h2>
<p>Below is a chart showing how startups ranked common customer service software features, such as price, ease of use, scalability, and support channels offered.  </p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="1a5e0308-1cd8-4fcb-a3a0-495fcb26d7de" data-type="interactive" data-title="test"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script></p>
<p>It’s not surprising that price was a top consideration for startups, who often have small budgets and big ambitions. Other top priorities included ease of use and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/startup-sales-process-guide/">sales CRM</a> capabilities. </p>
<p>But if you’re making the decision solely based on price, it will show. It helps to strike a balance between your team’s needs (price, ease of use, etc.) and the kind of experience you want your customers to have (self service help center, live chat, etc.)</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, many of the features correlated with faster startup growth ranked lower on the list. The <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/most-successful-startups-customer-experience-tips/">most successful startups</a> in our benchmark were more likely to invest in features such as self service help centers and omnichannel support, and they just might be the secret to success.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about the most important features you don&#8217;t want to overlook. </p>
<h2>3 important features you may be overlooking</h2>
<p>As a growing startup, this may be your first time shopping for a customer service solution. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to this experience, it can be really overwhelming to decide which features to prioritize. There&#8217;s no easy answer, but we want to help by shining a light on a few important features that companies big and small tend to overlook: </p>
<h3>1. Omnichannel support</h3>
<p>Omnichannel was one of the features startup founders ranked as lower priority, but it might be worth closer consideration. </p>
<p>Here’s why: Unicorns and fast-growing startups were much more likely to invest in omnichannel service than they’re slower-growth counterparts. This suggests that prioritizing omnichannel could give you a competitive edge. </p>
<blockquote><p>Unicorns were 37% more likely to offer omnichannel support</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HlAsW1RiA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">omnichannel approach</a> is that it allows you to provide a consistent, seamless experience on any service channel, whether you’re starting with just a few trusted channels or you’re scaling up to a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/omnichannel-really-means/">true omnichannel experience</a>. </p>
<p>Here are a few benefits of omnichannel customer service: </p>
<ul>
<li>Meet your customers where they are, even <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/instagram-for-business/">Instagram DMs</a>, and manage interactions from a single agent workspace</li>
<li>Switch between channels without losing customer context or asking customers to repeat themselves (an all too common problem)</li>
<li>Add or remove service channels as customer preferences inevitably change over time </li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Self service help center</h3>
<p>Sometimes good customer service means helping customers help themselves. </p>
<p>Research shows that 69% of customers want to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">resolve as many issues as possible on their own</a>, and 63% always or almost always start their search on a company’s website. </p>
<blockquote><p>69% of customers want to resolve as many issues as possible on their own</p></blockquote>
<p>Especially now in the midst of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/uncertain-world-knowledge-management/">knowledge is power</a>. Providing a self service help center gives customers greater control over their experience, and at the same time, it lightens the workload for your support team. </p>
<p>According to our startups benchmark, companies that went on to become unicorns were more likely to embrace self service, adopting it 61% faster than other startups in their first year. They were also more likely to have features like online help centers and community forums in place by year two. </p>
<p>So, what makes a good help center? Here are a few <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/3-best-knowledge-management-examples/">examples of brands doing it right</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Agent interface</h3>
<p>Empowering your support team to do their best work is critical. </p>
<p>According to Gartner research, 86% of CX leaders said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-06-14-gartner-survey-finds-employee-engagement-a-top-concern-affecting-customer-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employee engagement is essential in delivering CX improvements</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>86% of CX leaders said employee engagement is essential to improve CX</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/showpo/">Showpo</a>, an Australian-based clothing retailer, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/hidden-costs-of-freshdesk/">switched from Freshdesk to Zendesk</a> because Freshdesk’s multiple interfaces were confusing for agents. They were scrambling to access tools and data across multiple browser tabs, resulting in longer reply and resolution times. </p>
<p>Now with Zendesk’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support-suite/agent-workspace/#unify">unified agent workspace</a>, their first reply time for chats is just 26 seconds.</p>
<p><img src="https://zen-marketing-content.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/first-reply-time-hero.png" alt="Illustration of a stopwatch with arms and legs" /></p>
<h2>How CX software can increase productivity</h2>
<p>Your customer service software should simplify tasks, not create more of them. </p>
<p>To be able to handle more customer inquiries without driving up costs, you need a tool that can consolidate your customer conversations, apps, and data in a single, streamlined solution. </p>
<p>Here are a few software features you should look for that can help boost productivity: </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><strong>Intuitive workflow management </strong>
<p>You need a system that’s powerful enough to automate routine customer correspondence at scale. Building out <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/use-customer-service-email-templates-save-time/">email templates</a> and workflows will save you valuable time and effort, increase accuracy, and create a more consistent customer experience.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Apps and integrations</strong>
<p>It helps when you can <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/app-overview-startups/">integrate your favorite apps</a> into your support software, such as <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/slack/?q=mkp_Slack">Slack</a> for internal communication or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/qualtrics/?q=mkp_qualtrics">Qualtrics</a> for customer surveys. That way your agents can collaborate and share information without toggling between multiple tools.
</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>
<p>When demand for support is high, like many companies experienced in the wake of COVID-19, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/answer-bot-better-comprehension-more-languages-less-effort/">chatbots can do some of the work for you</a> by surfacing relevant answers from your knowledge base. This allows your agents to focus on the most complex or urgent issues while maintaining high satisfaction for customers with simple questions.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Invest wisely</h2>
<p>When choosing CX software, it’s important to think about it as more than just a cost–it’s an investment. It can also be a revenue driver when you tap into customer data and give agents the ability to personalize service to the customer, cross sell, and increase their lifetime value. </p>
<p>We like to say that CX is everyone&#8217;s job, and that&#8217;s definitely true when you&#8217;re a growing startup. You&#8217;re deciding what kind of experience you want your customers to have and determining what you need to make it happen. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no right or wrong answer, but here&#8217;s our advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put your customers first, but not at the expense of your agents</li>
<li>Stay true to what makes your brand shine</li>
<li>Be helpful, always</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to help startups with the cost of their CX investment. Eligible startups can get <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/startups/">6 months of Zendesk for free</a> and join a growing community of startup founders and CX leaders. </p>

<P>Keeping track of the sales funnel is an essential part of any sales and marketing strategy. By doing so, you’re able to keep a close eye on a lead&#8217;s journey from the top of the funnel to the bottom and make any necessary adjustments along the way. This process is called full-funnel tracking, and it is a vital approach to producing quality leads.</P></p>
<p><P>The sales funnel is a great way to get a visual of the process of turning leads into customers. The funnel represents the path narrowing as a lead gets closer and closer to the end goal: conversion. </P></p>
<p><img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/Sales%20funnel.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><P>Understanding this is essential because the full-funnel tracking approach isn’t quite as cut and dry as dropping the lead into the funnel and watching them move towards the bottom. Instead, there is a complete process that one must consider and refine in order to produce quality leads.</P> </div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</section>
<section class="accent-oat">
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<h2 align="center">What is a marketing funnel?</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p>The marketing funnel starts at the very top of the customer journey. Here, marketers try to gather as many leads as possible by reaching a very large target audience.</p>
<p>As the leads continue through the funnel, the path becomes more and more narrow, and the quality of leads begins to really shine through. As the funnel begins to narrow, more qualified leads will be targeted.
</p>
<p>This marketing approach is designed to reach potential leads based on where they might fall within the funnel. Since each lead requires a different approach, your marketing strategy might require some adjustments along the way.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</section>
<section>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p><H2>Why do you need full-funnel visibility?</H2></p>
<p>Without full-funnel visibility, you will be severely limited on options when it comes to lead generation and nurturing. If all you have is a visual on a single touch-point, then you really won’t have a clue when a lead will need guidance, much less what kind of guidance they might need.</p>
<p>Instead, if you implement full-funnel tracking and have a clear visual on each and every touch-point, you gain invaluable insight to ensure that the lead makes their way to the end of the funnel. By doing so, your lead generation campaigns can be optimized for conversions, not for leads.</p>
<p>For example, it’s quite common that by using tools such as Facebook Lead Ads, companies are able to generate a large volume of leads. </p>
<p>Problems arise when we want to receive more accurate information on lead quality. How many of these leads have requested a demo of your product or service? How many have started a trial? How many have bought something?</p>
<p><H2>Mid-funnel conversions</H2></p>
<p>Full-funnel tracking is also incredibly important for conversions that take place mid-funnel. Again, if we visualize the funnel, we can see that all the leads are collected at the very top. This could be a website visit, an ad form filled out, and so on. But as we make our way through the funnel, we can indeed have a conversion without a purchase.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the lead signs up for a trial, or they request a demo. These are very important conversions because they allow you to test your marketing funnel for bottlenecks. If you have 100 new leads, 50 request a demo, and only 1 goes on to make a purchase for the final conversion, then we can understand that there’s a potential issue. Somewhere along the way, the funnel is being bottlenecked, and the leads stop their journey through the funnel.</p>
<p>The reason this information is so important is that it allows you to investigate the possible issues. Ideally, this will allow you to address the problem, fix it, and increase your conversion rate altogether.
 </p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>

<section class="accent-tofu">
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<h2 align="center">What are the essential stages of the sales funnel?</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p><P>To achieve full-funnel tracking, it’s important to define the stages of your funnel. Marketers typically break the funnel into three stages: Awareness, consideration, and conversion.</P></p>
<p><P>In the awareness stage, the lead first becomes aware of your brand or product as a viable option for their needs. In the consideration stage, the lead begins to consider your product as an option. And finally, in the conversion stage, they take the plunge and become a customer.</P></p>
<p><img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/funnel_blog_images.001.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><P>This isn’t to say that you will only have 3 touch-points. In fact, depending on the company, there could even be 10 touch-points within each stage. The point is not to define your touch-points now, but to consider how to full-funnel track given these 3 stages.</P></p>
</div></div>
</p></div>
</section>
<section>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-default">
<p><H2>What should you be tracking?</H2><br />
Now we’re led to the question: What should you be tracking at each stage? Well, again, this depends on your campaign, company, and goals. </p>
<p>Overall, there are a number of things that you could be tracking. </p>
<h4>Here are a few examples given in each stage:</h4>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Awareness</h4>
<p>In the awareness stage, you’ll mainly be focusing on things like <a href="https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/facebook-lead-ads/zendesk/">Facebook Lead Ads</a> and online advertising in general. Here, You’ll want to keep track of your impressions and reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Consideration</h4>
<p>In the consideration stage of the marketing funnel, you’ll be focusing on more tactics like email marketing and retargeting. This is where a lot of nurturing will come into play, as you have to get the timing right. With the consideration stage, there are many metrics that you might want to consider tracking. For example, you may want to know how many leads requested a demo of your product or how many calls your sales team has made. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Conversion</h4>
<p>Conversion represents the moment when a specific goal of a marketing campaign is achieved. This is usually the sale of a specific service, but this is not always the case. For example, if a Saas may need to track, among its conversions, a Demo request or a trial of its product.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><H2>The most effective solution to full-funnel tracking</H2></p>
<p>When it comes to full-funnel tracking, there are a lot of steps and stages that need to be considered. In addition to that, you always have to be on your toes and ready to adapt for the lead’s sake. But, there is an easier way to do this.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/">LeadsBridge</a>, you can seamlessly integrate your marketing tools with your favorite sales CRMs like Zendesk Sell. By doing so, you’ll be able to grab the lead as soon as they enter a new stage of the sales funnel. All this is possible simply because you will have a better visual of their overall journey, and you’ll be ready as soon as they need nurturing.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Offline Conversation Tracking and Facebook&#8217;s Conversions API are designed to help advertisers track the conversions generated through their campaigns, all while maintaining proper data privacy as described by law. The API offers businesses the ability to share exactly what data they want, which is more than Cookies offer. Combining the two (Google OCT/Conversions API + Cookies) makes for the best experience when it comes to full-funnel visibility.</p>
<p>LeadsBridge helps companies seamlessly connect Google and Facebook to any CRM so that you can be sure to track all your leads in great detail, all the way through the funnel. This means that at every touchpoint and at every conversion (no matter what stage of the funnel it is), you will have a better plan on exactly what you need to do to keep the lead journey going, and most importantly you have visibility on which campaigns are producing more results.</p>
<p><H2>Focus on the metrics that matter</H2></p>
<p>As you can see, the full-funnel tracking approach allows you to focus on metrics that are truly important to your business. </p>
<p>To date, it is possible to obtain these metrics by exploiting the cookies installed on your website to track what is happening at the top of the funnel, and by linking the data contained in your CRM to your advertising platforms to understand exactly which campaigns generate conversions.</p>
<p>Full-funnel tracking and full-funnel marketing can seem a little linear, but it comes back full-circle. Once the leads make their way through the sales funnel, you can take the time to analyze what went right and what went wrong. This will ultimately lead to better and far more effective marketing efforts.</p></div>

<h2 id="What is a chatbot?">What is a chatbot?</h2>
<p>A chatbot is a scripted or self-learning AI tool programmed to converse with customers through an app, website, or messaging channel in a way that mimics a human conversation.
 </p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<h2 id="How does a chatbot work?">How does a chatbot work?</h2>
<p>A chatbot uses predefined rules, natural language processing, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/machine-learning-and-deep-learning/">machine learning, or deep learning</a> to interpret customer (or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/employees-customers-building-better-internal-help-desk-matters/">employee</a>) requests and provide responses.</p>
<p>Chatbots work best for interactions where customer needs are specific and clear. </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><b>A bot can work alongside a knowledge base to answer frequently asked questions by recommending relevant help center articles.</b> An airline service could deflect repetitive inquiries, like “How do I change my ticket?” with step-by-step instructions for that task. </li>
<li>With access to business and customer data, <b>chatbots can deliver more contextual and personalized responses.</b> If Mark wants to change his ticket to Hawaii, a bot can tell him available flights on his new travel date and that he’s eligible for a discount if he upgrades to first class. </li>
<li>Taking it a step further, <b>an AI chatbot can help customers interactively complete tasks.</b> Mark could point and click to reserve a window seat and purchase his upgraded ticket—inside the conversation thread.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Are chatbots going to steal customer service jobs?">Are chatbots going to steal customer service jobs?</h2>
<p>Chatbots are most successful when customer service leaders use them in conjunction with agents and foster <a href="https://diginomica.com/3-ways-businesses-embrace-ai-human-touch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agent-machine partnerships</a>. Humans will always be the secret sauce to a great customer experience. </p>
<p>Customers want to interact with real people, but they want those interactions to be meaningful. Low-stakes questions like ‘How do I change my password?’ are tasks customers prefer to resolve on-demand via self-service. </p>

<p> When bots take lackluster cases off a support team’s plate, agents can prioritize more engaging inquiries that require a human touch.</p>
<p>Chatbots can also start conversations on an agent&#8217;s behalf, capturing context like a customer’s order number or city upfront, before an agent takes over.</p>
<h3>How Fintiba’s chatbot empowers agents</h3>
<p>Fintiba offers online solutions for people who want to work or study in Germany. Agents are critical for resolving issues that require empathy, like when a customer’s visa gets declined.</p>
<p>Every conversation goes through Fintiba&#8217;s virtual agent before a human agent, alleviating pressure from Fintiba’s support team. </p>
<p>For example, when customers want to change their account phone number, they complete a form and attach a selfie for identification inside Fintiba’s chatbot. An agent can then jump in with the process already started.  </p>
<p>Fintiba’s chatbot solution, Solvemate, can route conversations to agents—complete with context and conversation history—because it <a href="https://www.solvemate.com/en/casestudy-fintiba.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">integrates</a> with Fintinba’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/customer-service-management-software/">customer service software</a>. </p>

<h2 id="Chatbot business benefits">Benefits of chatbots that go beyond efficiency and cost savings</h2>
<p>Chatbots have <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/5-innovative-ways-brands-using-bots-help-customers-connect/">benefits beyond</a> “increasing efficiency” and “cutting costs”—that’s table stakes.<br />
Here are a few ways humans can work in tandem with chatbots to solve key business challenges.   </p>
<h3>Challenge: Customers want a more convenient way to get live one-to-one help—24/7</h3>
<p><b>How a bot can help:</b></p>
<p>Being constantly connected has increased customers’ desire for instant support. Customers today expect help as soon as they need it, on channels convenient for them. </p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>Over 40 percent of customers consider 24/7 support, in real-time, a top component of a good customer experience.</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p> In fact, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Zendesk’s findings</a> revealed that over 40 percent of customers consider 24/7 support, in real-time, a top component of a good customer experience. And a study by Accenture found that <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm">83 percent</a> of churned customers insist that better live customer service would have impacted their decision to switch providers. </p>
<p>If Sally’s lunch delivery order is delayed, she can text a chatbot to ask where her sushi is and get an update on her California roll in real-time. If Rachel lost her credit card, a virtual assistant can help her pause it over her bank’s mobile app, so she doesn’t have to worry about mysterious charges while she tries to find it.</p>
<p>In deploying a chatbot across customers’ preferred channels, businesses ensure customers get seamless, always-on support.</p>
<h3>Challenge: Customer requests are increasing and the business needs to scale quickly</h3>
<p><b>How a bot can help:</b> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">42 percent</a> of customer service leaders expect customer requests to grow, yet only 36 percent can expand headcount. This gap represents a sweet spot where a chatbot can help.</p>
<blockquote><p>42 percent of customer service leaders expect customer requests to grow, yet only 36 percent can expand headcount.</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a small team, Spartan Race deployed <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/">Zendesk’s Answer Bot</a> to help its agents tackle spikes in customer requests during races—races are hard to staff for because they occur on weekends. Spartan Race has seen a 9.5 percent decrease in chat volume, extending its support team’s live chat availability by 3 hours every day from time savings.</li>
<li>As France’s national rail carrier, SNCF needed to provide quick support to impatient passengers on-the-go using its new mobile app. But it couldn’t hire another team of agents to deal with the influx of requests. <a href="https://www.mindsay.com/customers/sncf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mindsay&#8217;s Zendesk integration</a> enabled SNCF to take pressure off its overwhelmed agents and deploy a chatbot to help customers find travel itineraries, provide departure information, and send alerts—leading to a 50 percent reduction in incoming support tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chatbots give support teams the ability to scale with less. </p>
<h3>Challenge: The business is missing out on opportunities for conversion</h3>
<p><b>How a bot can help:</b></p>
<p>Customer service bots can boost conversions with smarter self-service.  </p>
<p>A chatbot can enable customers to self-serve outside of a help center, like on a checkout page, with knowledge tailored to their context. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/forrester-proactive-chat/">55 percent</a> of online shoppers abandon a purchase because they can’t find an answer to a question quickly. Dollar Shave Club uses Answer Bot</a> to welcome website visitors with help center articles and answer questions it can anticipate—before a customer abandons their cart.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://youtu.be/xkKXENv5APY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netomi’s Zendesk integration</a>, Freshly deflects around 2,200 tickets each week. Its chatbot collects website visitor’s email addresses before they ask a question, which serves a dual purpose of capturing context for agents and capturing leads for marketing teams. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/wavy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wavy uses a chatbot</a> to help with prospecting and lead generation. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/chat/botmind/?q=mkp_botmind" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Botmind’s Zendesk integration</a> made it easy to set up and increased conversion by 25 percent.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>55 percent of online shoppers abandon a purchase because they can’t find an answer to a question quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking it to the next level, chatbots can convert customers inside the messenger by providing opportunities for immediate action with rich messaging types like carousels, forms, and picklists—whether that’s booking a hotel reservation or purchasing a pair of shoes. </p>
<p>Chatbots can also automate cross-sell and up-sell activities. With the right context, a bot can check if Sam is eligible for a discount on a hotel room with a view or ask if he wants a pair of socks to match his new Nikes.</p>
<h2 id="Picking the right bot">4 questions to consider when evaluating a customer service chatbot</h2>
<p>Chatbots are relatively new to customer service, and companies are still figuring out how they fit within their broader support strategies. This makes it challenging to know how to find the right bot for your business.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to consider.</p>
<h3>What problem are you looking to solve—and what resources do you need to solve it?</h3>
<p>A business will need to decide what use cases to automate based on the problem it wants to solve and its resources, for starters.</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p>Companies looking to automate simple, frequently asked questions often already have a solution they can leverage—their knowledge base. FAQs are low-hanging fruit that work well with out-of-the-box solutions, like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/answer-bot-better-comprehension-more-languages-less-effort/">Answer Bot</a>.
  </div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>This type of AI-powered bot enables teams to get fast time to value, serving help center articles across a variety of channels from email to mobile SDKs to Slack, and capturing basic customer context along the way. </p>
<p>Some companies want to deflect more interactive or personalized requests, like telling Kate how much data her iPhone used this month or recommending a new plan based on her data needs. </p>
<p>This requires more resources, like developers (and a bigger budget). They’ll also need a chatbot solution that <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/chatbot/">integrates with their customer service software</a> and other relevant systems. </p>
<p>Other businesses are looking for a highly customized chatbot that serves more engaging and actionable content or requires multi-step workflows (like giving Kate the ability to purchase a new phone plan inside the conversation thread). They’ll likely need in-house developers.</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>Rich chatbot experiences also require a <a href="https://smooch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">powerful chatbot platform</a> to provide the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sunshine’s <a href="https://smooch.io/conversation-extensions/">Conversation Extensions</a> arms businesses with tools to build the kind of next-generation conversational experiences that enable customers to complete purchases, surveys, appointments, maps, or multi-selects—within the messenger.
     </div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<h3>What channels do you want to use—and what features will you need on those channels?</h3>
<p>A business should optimize its chatbot for how customers will consume it. </p>
<p>Think about channels your customers engage with the most. Customers expect to get support over their preferred touchpoints—whether they’re interacting with a human or a bot.  </p>
<p>If your customers spend time on your website or mobile app, a bot might welcome them there—but that’s table stakes. </p>
<p>Research tells us customers want to interact with brands on channels they use with friends or family. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/difference-chat-messaging/">Messaging channels,</a> like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Twitter Direct Message, LINE, Apple Business Chat (which integrates with iMessage), or SMS lend themselves to more convenient conversational experiences.  </p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://withplum.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plum</a>, a Facebook Messenger chatbot, also available on the Plum app, sends users personalized savings advice. Or, Samsung Australia created a <a href="https://marketing.twitter.com/en/success-stories/how-samsung-delivered-personalized-tv-recommendations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter chatbot</a> to give customers personalized TV recommendations.</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p>Beyond channel breadth, a business should consider features it will need on those channels. </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Quick replies allow customers to find answers in a few clicks instead of typing</li>
<li>Adding a call-to-action button increases click-through-rate <a href="https://smooch.io/rich-message-framework/">3 times</a></li>
<li>Carousels result in 10 times higher engagement</li>
<li>In-chat conversion-to-purchase rate is 2.3 times higher compared to a website or mobile app</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>Sunshine Conversations enables a business to build once and deploy anywhere—in other words; deploy the same or best version of a rich bot experience across channels, even those with no native bot support. </p>
<h3>What level of context will your chatbot need?</h3>
<p><a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/context-leads-better-chatbots-better-conversation/">More context leads to better chatbots</a>—and better-personalized conversations. </p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.ada.support/learning-centre/webinar/upwork-automation-first-strategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ada’s Zendesk integration</a>, Upwork deployed a chatbot that displays proactive CTAs tailored to what a user is trying to accomplish, such as CTAs based on what help center article a user is viewing.  </p>
<p>Upwork’s bot also has contextual metadata like a user’s name for personalized greetings and knows if a user is a client or a freelancer, tailoring quick replies accordingly. It also integrates with our Support Suite, so agents have the context they need to handle every escalated interaction effectively.</p>
<p>Beyond passing on relevant information to agents, bots can also pass on context to a CRM or other software to inform a future interaction. This enables things like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding that Rose has a necklace in her cart and sending a message to a marketing automation tool, so she receives better-targeted email offers</li>
<li>Knowing that IT Buyer Bob signed up for a demo and qualifying him as a lead in a sales CRM</li>
</ul>
<p>Bots can read context coming from a conversation itself, too. With sentiment analysis, a virtual agent can understand when a customer is frustrated and react accordingly. </p>
<h3>How will you manage conversations between chatbots and agents?</h3>
<p>Businesses need tools to both deploy chatbot conversations on the front-end and manage them on the back-end. </p>
<p>This ensures agents can understand the intent behind every conversation and streamline handoffs between agents and chatbots. </p>
<p>With the help of triggers, automation, and workflows, support teams can centrally define engagement rules and track, manage, and prioritize chatbot interactions at scale. This opens up possibilities like automatically assigning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high priority to VIP customers so a bot can route them to a live salesperson for help—with conversation history</li>
<li>A repeat dissatisfied customer to a specialized customer support team–by looking at context, sentiment, and intent</li>
</ul>
<p>To effectively control bot interactions, a business will need to integrate its chatbot solution with its customer service software, for example, through our Bot APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support-suite/agent-workspace/">The Agent Workspace</a> inside our Support Suite provides agents with a real-time, conversation-focused interface to seamlessly manage conversations between agents and bots.</p>
<h2>Rephrase the conversation</h2>
<p><a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/ai-helping-solve-human-problems/">AI</a> is key to delivering fast, convenient, and personalized experiences customers expect. </p>
<p>The question is no longer “Should we use chatbots?” so much as “Where and how should we use chatbots?” to better serve our customers. </p>
<p>When a business balances the power of virtual agents with human agents&#8217; power, it can create the kind of customer service chatbot that drives loyalty—and improves the bottom line</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&rsquo;s customer experience (CX) leaders too often rush into the customer experience map-making process before answering some fundamental questions. The result: massive misperceptions that lead to poor communication and misguided assumptions about your customers&rsquo; experiences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about a harmless misunderstanding: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/customer-experience-marketers-doing-it-wrong-study-finds">an Acquia study</a> reports that 90% of customers say most brands fail to meet their expectations when it comes to delivering good customer experience. Meanwhile, 82% of marketers believe they&rsquo;re hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Anyone who seeks to bridge such a huge chasm between customer realities and marketer perceptions will definitely need a good map.</p>
<p>At Zendesk, mapping our customer experiences is an ongoing pursuit. We look to Holly Vande Walle, our Director of Advocacy Training and Quality, to steer us in the right direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;Mapping is incredibly important because our customers are so different from one another, even within segments. So we look at our enterprise level, our small, medium business, our startups, and have at least some sort of an experience map for each of them, understanding the nuances, and what type of staff they have on hand to work through troubleshooting or admin issues.&rdquo;<br />
  <cite>Holly Vande Walle</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Holly brings a wealth of insights to the map-making process. One of her biggest pieces of wisdom: ask the right questions, so you can get the most accurate data from your customers and your teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a very delicate balance,&rdquo; Holly says. &ldquo;We&#8217;re looking at everything with that two-sided lens of the customer and the support person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before you start creating your customer experience map, answer these eight questions about its goals, focus, and process. Once you do, you&rsquo;ll have the keys to a truly revealing, helpful CX map that gives you a customer-level view of your company.</p>
<h2>1. What&rsquo;s it for?</h2>
<p>While you may know the definition of a CX map, the purpose of your particular map may not be as obvious.</p>
<p>Some companies need CX maps to help their customer-facing team members build <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/beyond-bottom-line-building-business-customer-empathy/">empathy</a> with the people they serve. Others build a CX map to give teams insights based on recent customer research. Still others build CX maps to use as inspiration for improvements to existing processes or as a way to envision new products and services.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know why you&rsquo;re making a customer experience map</h3>
<p>Identify <em>why </em>you&rsquo;re building this map &mdash; what do you hope to accomplish with it? What problem are you trying to solve? Why does your organization need it?</p>
<p>The purpose of your CX map will guide all of the elements contained in it.</p>
</div>
<h2>2. How will it be used?</h2>
<p>If you need to capture the customer experience in real time (the way a satellite map captures weather or traffic conditions), consider creating <strong>a dynamic CX map</strong> that acts as a living document.</p>
<p>You can use it for strategy-building workshops, where the process is more important than the final presentation. It&rsquo;s up to your team to fill in the details as part of the learning process. You can also use it as a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-experience-management-software/">dashboard for your CX leaders</a> to consult as they gauge the health of your customer experiences and determine how to improve it.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk Explore dashboard" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/zendesk-explore-drag-drop-dashboard.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Zendesk Explore&rsquo;s drag-and-drop dashboard can act as a real-time, dynamic map of your customer experience.</p>
<p>Creating a living document means your map will need an open format that can easily change as your team collects new data. But if you need to share a visual representation of the customer experience with folks across your organization, a <strong>static CX map</strong> may be the best way to go.</p>
<p>Static CX maps should include as many details as possible to tell the full story while also being easy to interpret. Capture big-picture views instead of more subtle customer interactions. A professional designer can help you turn your data into a clear, visual message.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Static customer experience map" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/static-customer-experience-map.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">A static map designed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/customer-journey-maps">Diego Bernardo</a> captures &ldquo;The Journey of Diabetes&rdquo; &mdash; what a diabetes patient experiences within the healthcare system from symptoms through diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Use a static CX map in a slide deck, in team-training materials, or even as a poster for teams to refer to in meetings.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know the function of your CX map</h3>
<p>Understanding <em>how</em> your organization plans to use the map will help you plan the form it will take.</p>
</div>
<h2>3. Who&rsquo;s it for?</h2>
<p>If your map will be used by <strong>external stakeholders,</strong> look at your company from the outside in. Since they&rsquo;re not as familiar with your products, services, and internal processes, they&rsquo;ll need more context. For example, a sales training consultant will need to understand how and why the customer experience changes in a high-touch sales process compared to a self-serve sales process.</p>
<p>If your map will be used by<strong> internal stakeholders,</strong> it should show customer interactions from the inside out. Your employees will need more context on experiences outside their normal perspective. For example, if your sales team is immersed in the sales process, they&rsquo;ll benefit from seeing all the marketing interactions that happen from the customer&rsquo;s point of view before the customer even talks to sales.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know the audience of your CX map</h3>
<p>Your CX map is telling the story of how your customers see your company. Knowing who will use the map will help you decide on which details to include so your core message is clear and any insights are actionable.</p>
</div>
<h2>4. What are you capturing?</h2>
<p>Determining the scope of your map will help you know where you&rsquo;ll get your data. It will also determine how granular your data will need to be. There are three main types of CX maps, each with a different level of focus:</p>
<p><strong>1) Inventory map &#8211;</strong> If you want to capture all customer touchpoints, make an inventory map. Think of this map as a world atlas: you&rsquo;re getting a high-level view of the overall customer experience. Your customer touchpoints are like the continents. Unless your inventory map is highly dynamic and allows you to &ldquo;zoom in&rdquo; (like the example from Starbucks below), it&rsquo;s hard to get on-the-ground details on individual touchpoints.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Starbucks customer experience map" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/sbux-customer-experience-map.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Example of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theoperationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/experiencemap1.pdf">Starbucks Experience Map</a>, an inventory of all customer touchpoints and interactions when visiting a store.</p>
<p><strong>2) Activity map &#8211;</strong> If you want to capture, explore, or improve customer interactions related to specific touchpoints, make an activity map. While the inventory map is like a world atlas, your activity map is like a roadmap: not only will you see the &ldquo;intersections&rdquo; where your company and your customer cross paths, with the right data, you&rsquo;ll also see if there&rsquo;s any &ldquo;congestion&rdquo; (i.e. poor customer experiences).</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Customer experience map for a government agency" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/customer-experience-map-proof-of-age.jpg" /></p>
<p class="caption">Example of an activity map from a government agency centered around obtaining an ID. [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://grooveyard.ie/experiential-marketing-why-customer-journeys-are-so-important/">Source</a>]</p>
<p><strong>3) Data capture map &#8211;</strong> If you want to get a snapshot of how your company collects customer data at each touchpoint (or envision how you plan to do so), make a data capture map. Think of a data capture map like a city planning map: you&rsquo;re focusing on the infrastructure that supports your customer experience. It alone will not give you customer insights and is best used as an overlay on an activity or inventory map.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Simplified customer experience map" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/simplified-b2b-customer-experience-map.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">A simplified CX map that plots the touchpoints where a B2B company can capture customer data and feedback. [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.useresponse.com/blog/customer-experience-mapping/">Source</a>]</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know the scope of your map</h3>
<p>How much data will you need to collect to tell the clearest story of your customer&rsquo;s experience? Deciding on the scope of your map early on will help you stick to the facts you&rsquo;ll be collecting.</p>
</div>
<h2>5. Who are you studying?</h2>
<p>Your customers&rsquo; expectations and outcomes differ based on who they are and where they&rsquo;re coming from. Knowing the different types of customers you&rsquo;re following will help you create a more accurate map with a sharper focus.</p>
<h3>Identify your customer segments</h3>
<p>At Zendesk, we&rsquo;ve grown from serving mostly small businesses to supporting enterprise-level organizations. This experience taught us the importance of mapping experiences by customer segment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we recommend a fix or [launch] an app, the reaction that we&#8217;re going to get based on the different segments is totally different,&rdquo; says Holly. &ldquo;There might be a huge bureaucracy to go through at an enterprise level customer versus a mom and pop shop, [who can say] &#8216;yep, we can do that.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You should not only consider how experiences vary based on the size of the customer but also based on the culture they&rsquo;re coming from. Holly says she&rsquo;s currently leading an initiative to review how international audiences experience our knowledge base and help content, and improving the experience goes beyond simple translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You also have to consider that what a Japanese customer wants is different than what a German customer wants,&rdquo; Holly says. &ldquo;It&#8217;s not just the language. Different <em>ways of talking</em> are going to cause a different reaction.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Segregate existing and targeted groups of customers</h3>
<p>The history of your company&rsquo;s relationship with your customers also impacts how they see interactions.</p>
<p>If someone is visiting your website or your store for the first time, they&rsquo;re seeing it differently than a long-time customer who knows their way around. Likewise, a prospective customer interacting with your sales rep brings a different set of expectations with them than a customer with a long history with your company.</p>
<h3>Pick Your customer personas</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/grow-customer-base/">customer persona</a> &mdash; a marketer&rsquo;s favorite resource for understanding the internal and external factors behind your customers&rsquo; buying decisions. Customer personas are built for initiatives like CX mapping.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working on mapping a retail, ecommerce, or B2C software experience, plot the journeys of individual customer personas. If you&rsquo;re creating a CX map for a B2B product, consider <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rankscience.com/blog/b2b-lead-generation">using the personas that exist in a buying group</a> and how their role impacts interactions with your company.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know which customers you&rsquo;re tracking</h3>
</div>
<h2>6. Who has the data you need?</h2>
<p>Successful CX mapping is a collaborative effort internally. It&rsquo;s an excuse to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/duet-sell-and-support/">break down the silos</a> that get in the way of so many customer experience initiatives. Whether a contributor is coming to you from sales or customer support or they&rsquo;re working as admins or agents, your internal teams are an invaluable resource with plenty of knowledge to share.</p>
<p>With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mycustomer.com/resources/customer-journey-mapping-research-report-2018">46% of CX leaders</a> reporting that the CX mapping process is &ldquo;extremely positive&rdquo; when co-led by multiple stakeholders &mdash; and with tools like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/">Zendesk Explore</a> that allow teams to share real-time insights &mdash; you have every reason to collaborate.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know who&rsquo;s providing your customer experience mapping data</h3>
<p>Your internal teams help facilitate data collection at various external touchpoints, but the single source of truth for a CX map is always your customer&rsquo;s point of view. At Zendesk, we rely on both qualitative data (like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/are-customer-surveys-effective/">customer satisfaction surveys</a>) and quantitative data (like interviews, call recordings, and product reviews) for our CX mapping initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a group of people who did interviews with customers,&rdquo; says Holly. &ldquo;We brought in customers who are known to have good [customer satisfaction scores] C-SAT and customers who are known to have bad C-SAT. And then we interviewed those customers to understand &lsquo;what is it that drove you to evaluate your service at this level or that level?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h2>7. What does it tell you?</h2>
<p>Each time you look at your CX map, you should be able to take a lesson from it about how your customers see your company.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://customerthink.com/stop-practicing-fake-cx/">CustomerThink</a> identifies three assessment criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delivers on brand promise &#8211;</strong> Does this experience keep the promise you made to your customers? For example, if you&rsquo;re GEICO, is this experience helping your customer save 15 percent on their car insurance in 15 minutes or less?</li>
<li><strong>Creates value for customers &#8211; </strong>Does your customer come away with more value as a result of this experience? In other words, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/marketing/understanding_customers/value_exchange.htm">what is the value exchanged at each interaction</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Achieves business results</strong> <strong>&#8211;</strong> Does this experience translate to customer acquisition (first-time purchase), customer retention (repeat purchase), or referrals (positive word of mouth)?</li>
</ul>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know how to objectively assess your CX map</h3>
<p>Although your customers&rsquo; points of view are highly subjective, the outcome of each interaction and the learnings you come away with should be objective.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t answer the simple yes/no questions above, you&rsquo;re probably overcomplicating your CX map by placing too much emphasis on customer emotions and not enough on customer outcomes.</p>
</div>
<h2>8. Where will it take you?</h2>
<p>Your CX map is more than just a snapshot &mdash; it can be a dashboard with dials you can turn as you see areas that need action.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/10-customer-experience-kpis/">Start measuring</a> the impact of your CX efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use barometers like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/measure-customer-satisfaction/">CSAT</a> and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-effort/">customer effort scores</a> to keep an eye on customer sentiment and satisfaction.</li>
<li>Track your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.getcensus.com/a-single-metric-to-drive-customer-success-teams/">Product Activity Coefficient (PAC)</a> to measure the engagement of your existing customers.</li>
<li>Apply measurement to adoption, acceleration, and advocacy &mdash; here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/how-we-measure-the-customer-experience/">how we do it at Zendesk</a>.</li>
<li>Focus on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/untapped-roi-customer-service/">the ROI of your customer experience</a> &mdash; there&rsquo;s no crime in following the money.</li>
</ul>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Key takeaway: Know what steps to take next</h3>
<p>Have a plan for how you&rsquo;ll translate the customer experience into business impact and how you&rsquo;ll test new initiatives in real time.</p>
</div>
<h2>A well-made customer experience map is an ever-evolving source of truth</h2>
<p>By asking the right questions and answering them with the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-experience-management-software/">right tools</a>, you can create a comprehensive CX map with a wealth of insights on your customer experience. Then you can quickly identify and prioritize changes that need to be made. The results: the biggest improvements and best outcomes for your business and customers.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="what">What is WhatsApp Business?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business/">WhatsApp Business</a> offers an app and API to businesses looking to communicate with their customers on the WhatsApp platform. </p>
<p>The free WhatsApp Business app is meant for small businesses that need an out-of-the-box solution for messaging their customers on WhatsApp. Larger teams that need a little more control over their customers&rsquo; experiences can leverage the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api/?lang=fb">WhatsApp Business API</a>. </p>
<h3>WhatsApp Business App</h3>
<p>The WhatsApp Business app provides a simple, ready-to-go messaging solution. It allows businesses to chat one-on-one with their customers, like texting, but with an internet connection instead of SMS.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="WhatsApp Business example" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/whatsapp-business-1.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">[<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business/">Source</a>] WhatsApp Business lets you easily connect one-on-one with your customers.</p>
<p>The app also lets you set up automatic replies for common customer questions and sort through your messages quickly and easily. The &ldquo;labels&rdquo; feature lets you organize your conversations into different buckets, like &#8220;open customer issues&#8221; or &#8220;new orders.&#8221; </p>
<p>Best part is, it&rsquo;s free and fast to set up. This makes it the ideal solution for small teams that need only basic messaging capabilities.</p>
<h3>WhatsApp Business API</h3>
<p>The WhatsApp Business API provides even more features. You can use it to notify multiple customers at once about invoices, receipts, and shipping updates. Customers can also opt-in to sales and promotional notifications. With these features, WhatsApp Business makes offering customer support fast and simple. </p>
<p>However, these added capabilities come with a price and some complexity&#8230;</p>
<h2 id="when">When the WhatsApp Business API for Support makes sense</h2>
<p>Is the WhatsApp Business API a good fit for your company? It depends on your customers&rsquo; messaging app preferences and how much you can invest in the platform. Before you adopt the tool, make sure your target customer is using the platform and your team is able to implement it. </p>
<h3>Your customer base is international</h3>
<p>If you have a lot of international customers, you should strongly consider using WhatsApp Business API for support. </p>
<p>WhatsApp is by far the most popular in India, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/289778/countries-with-the-most-facebook-users/">340 million users in 2019</a>, and 99 million in Brazil. Although the United States has 68 million WhatsApp users, Facebook Messenger is way more popular, with 106.4 million users.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="WhatsApp users by country" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/whatsapp-users-by-coutnry.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">[<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/289778/countries-with-the-most-facebook-users/">Source</a>] WhatsApp is by far the most popular in India, with 340 million users in 2019.</p>
<h3>You have the budget for it</h3>
<p>To use the WhatsApp Business API, you&rsquo;ll need to pay for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api">integrations</a>, like connecting it to your CRM. Integration costs depend on which partner you go through and what pricing structure they use. </p>
<p>Each partner also has ongoing fees, though the structure varies from company to company. The two most common pricing structures for partners are flat monthly fee, or charge per message. Depending on your provider and your message volume, expect to pay anywhere from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://respond.io/blog/whatsapp-business-api-pricing/">$50-$1500</a> in flat monthly fees, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://respond.io/blog/whatsapp-business-api-pricing/">$0.002-$0.007</a> per message. </p>
<p>Along with equipment and software costs, make sure you have enough support staff to monitor WhatsApp. Over <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">40% of customers </a>expect a chat response in less than an hour, so you&rsquo;ll need agents who can resolve issues quickly. </p>
<h3>Your target customers are younger</h3>
<p>WhatsApp is popular with young generations. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/whatsapp-statistics/">Fifty-five percent</a> of the platform&rsquo;s users are between 18 and 35 years old. </p>
<p>This trend is true for many messaging apps, not just WhatsApp. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Forty percent</a> of millennials and Gen Z users expect to resolve issues with businesses using messaging compared with only 18% of baby boomers. </p>
<p>If your target customer fits these age demographics&mdash;and you meet the other factors mentioned above&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to consider investing in the WhatsApp Business API.</p>
<h2 id="how">3 tips for connecting with customers using the WhatsApp Business API</h2>
<p>To connect with customers on WhatsApp, you can&rsquo;t treat it like any other communication channel. People are used to having fast, casual chats on the platform&mdash;not formal business conversations. Adapt to this communication style to keep customers engaged and eager to respond. </p>
<h3>Be prepared for the whatsapp business service window</h3>
<p>The WhatsApp Business API gives you only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/?lang=en">24 hours to respond to a customer&rsquo;s message</a> since customers expect a pretty quick turnaround with messaging. If you miss the service window, the customer has to opt back in to continue chatting. </p>
<p>This creates more work for the customer, so they&rsquo;re less likely to continue chatting. Keep customers engaged by always trying to respond within the business service window. Make sure you have enough live support agents to reply to customers. And when live support isn&rsquo;t available, you can set up <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/chatbot/">chatbots</a> to keep the conversation moving. </p>
<h3>Harness templates to speed up your messaging</h3>
<p>Sometimes, support agents can&rsquo;t respond to WhatsApp messages directly. The agents may be dealing with other inquiries or may have signed off for the day. In these cases, you&rsquo;ll want to have preset responses ready to keep the conversation going. That&rsquo;s where message templates come in. </p>
<p>Create a standardized message based on common questions, and set up a WhatsApp bot to automatically send it to customers. The bot will customize the response based on the customer&rsquo;s message and their unique information. These templates are especially useful for shipping confirmations, support ticket updates, and post-support surveys.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="WhatsApp template message example" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/whatsapp-template-message.jpeg" /></p>
<p class="caption">An example of a WhatsApp template message.</p>
<p>Besides being convenient, message templates are also necessary for directly contacting customers. To minimize spam, WhatsApp asks businesses to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/policies/business-policy">create a template message before reaching out to customers</a>. Until WhatsApp approves the template, businesses have to wait for customers to reach out first. </p>
<h3>Use conversational language to connect to your customers</h3>
<p>Most customers are used to sending WhatsApp chats filled with emojis and exclamation points. If your messaging style doesn&rsquo;t match that of your customers, they likely won&rsquo;t be interested in communicating with your brand. </p>
<p>Keep customers engaged with a casual, approachable tone: </p>
<ul>
<li>Write how you speak. Practice reading sentences out loud to see whether they sound like natural conversation.</li>
<li>Use contractions like &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cannot.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Add color to your messages, and set the right tone with emojis. Smiley faces are generally safe, but stick to only one per message so they don&rsquo;t become overwhelming.</li>
<li>Keep the tone of your messages in mind. Use exclamation points and incomplete sentences to keep messages upbeat and cheerful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply these tips to your templates, and make sure your agents are familiar with them as well. If you use this casual style across your support communication, customers should feel comfortable messaging your brand. </p>
<h3>Make sure your customers know WhatsApp is an option</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll only see the benefits of the WhatsApp Business API if your customers know you&#8217;re using the platform.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="a business promoting itself as being on WhatsApp" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/whatsapp-presence-promotion.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">[<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gonorthwest.co.uk/news-service-updates/were-whatsapp-get-touch-now/">Source</a>] An example of a business promoting their WhatsApp presence.</p>
<p>Once your WhatsApp integration is live, make sure customers know about it. Use social media accounts to promote and encourage customers to connect with you on WhatsApp. Make sure there&rsquo;s a visible, clickable widget on your website directing customers to your WhatsApp Business homepage. If you have an app, make sure your WhatsApp is clearly displayed on that, too. The more chances you give customers to connect with you on their favorite platforms, the more engagement you can expect. </p>
<h2>Access WhatsApp Business right from your CRM</h2>
<p>For brands with international customer bases, WhatsApp is a powerful support platform. But managing a larger volume of customer conversations through mobile devices makes it difficult for agents to serve customers efficiently. Support staff will only be able to work from tiny screens, and they&rsquo;ll need to switch from their phone to their computer to record interactions.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk WhatsApp integration" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/whatsapp-integration-zendesk.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Zendesk&rsquo;s WhatsApp integration lets your support team respond to WhatsApp messages right from their customer service dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/message/">Zendesk&rsquo;s WhatsApp integration</a> offers a seamless experience for your support pros. They&rsquo;re able to send and receive WhatsApp messages directly from Zendesk alongside other channels like live chat, email, and voice, so they don&rsquo;t have to switch back and forth between different support management tools. Your customer records will also automatically update with the details of the interaction, just like any other Zendesk support channel. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowledge is power, especially in the world of customer service. According to the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">2020 CX Trends Report</a>, companies that leverage the most data have 36% faster resolutions, 79% reduction in customer wait time, and four times as many solved customer requests.</p>
<p>But to reap those benefits, you need a powerful business intelligence tool. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/#features">Zendesk Explore</a> allows you to identify important trends, find ways to improve your team&rsquo;s interactions with customers, and gauge customer satisfaction with your brand. Companies that use Explore handle 3.4 times as many tickets as those that don&rsquo;t use the tool, and their customers spend half as long waiting for agents to respond.</p>
<p>How does it make such a big difference? Explore tracks and measures every aspect of the customer experience. And it makes all of those analytics more accessible than ever with custom reports and dashboards you can use to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-experience-management-software/">manage and optimize CX</a>.</p>
<h2>Understanding every customer interaction with omnichannel analytics</h2>
<p>Customer support interactions can happen anywhere, from a call center to a comment on a social media post. Explore tracks data across every communication channel to give you visibility into the full customer experience.</p>
<p>It also makes it easier to figure out your customers&rsquo; preferred contact methods so that you can prioritize and optimize your most popular channels. For example, tracking ticket volume by channel and day of the week lets you know which channels are used most frequently and when they are most active.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Omnichannel analytics in Zendesk Explore" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/omnichannel-analytics-explore.png" /></p>
<p>Similarly, tracking <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660816-Customizing-your-customer-satisfaction-survey">customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores</a> and wait times gives you a good indicator of each channel&rsquo;s effectiveness. The channels with the highest satisfaction rates and fastest resolution times are the ones you&rsquo;ll want to invest in and promote to users.</p>
<p>The lifestyle brand <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spartan.com/">Spartan Race</a> has used Explore to continually optimize their AI-powered <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/">answer bots</a>, which suggest articles to customers based on their chat queries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are tracking the resolution rate of suggested articles to see if they&rsquo;re adequately deflecting a customer request,&rdquo; explains <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgforbes/">Andrew Forbes</a>, Zendesk&rsquo;s group manager of product marketing. &ldquo;And then they&rsquo;re looking through all their articles to see how folks are voting on those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If an article has a low satisfaction score, the company works to adjust it or create new knowledge content that will better answer customer questions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one aspect of one channel; Explore integrates with every part of the Zendesk suite to help users get the most out of their software.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our customers use Explore to analyze data from all the Zendesk products that they use,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;Explore integrates with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/">Zendesk Support</a>, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/">Chat</a>, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/">Talk</a>, and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/guide/">Guide</a> and allows folks to dig in on all the customer support interactions that happen across those products.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Tracking customer experience with pre-built and customizable dashboards</h2>
<p>The design and complexity of your dashboard should reflect the needs and size of your organization. Startups tend to have simpler dashboards than enterprises, just like people who drive Honda Pilots have smaller instrument panels than people who pilot passenger jets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customers get pre-built dashboards right out of the box with Explore,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re great for teams that are just starting to provide service to their customers for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For startups and SMBs, these fresh-out-of-the-box dashboards come complete with hundreds and hundreds of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/best-customer-support-metrics/">table-stakes metrics</a>. Explore provides instant insight into some of the most important customer experience trends you need to be following.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Zendesk Explore dashboard" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/dashboard-explore.png" /></p>
<p>Even larger, more established companies often make use of these dashboards. The crafts shopping site <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, for example, has used many of Explore&rsquo;s pre-built metrics to improve CX operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etsy&rsquo;s core use case is measuring team performance and understanding how their agents are doing,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;So they&rsquo;re digging in on things like first response times, satisfaction scores by different agents and teams, and how quickly agents can resolve different issue types.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that information at their fingertips, the company is &ldquo;now able to surface problem areas from our tickets, quickly fix routing rules, and identify training opportunities for our team,&rdquo; says <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wreckingadm/">Colin Wilkinson</a>, senior manager of agent enablement at Etsy&rsquo;s Member Services.</p>
<p>For organizations that require tailored solutions, Explore also allows users to build custom dashboards from scratch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, a retailer is probably loading in some loyalty program information, so they might segment their customers by high value, medium value, and low value,&rdquo; Andrew offers.</p>
<p>In that case, high-level information, such as CSAT scores, can be broken down by more targeted metrics, such as customer types or demographics.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="CSAT scores in Zendesk Explore" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/csat-scores-explore.png" /></p>
<p>Many companies &ndash; including Zendesk &ndash; will also build new dashboards for big events, such as updates or product launches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we launch a new product, our support team has a dashboard tracking how many tickets we get about it and how we&rsquo;re handling those,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;We want to make sure that we&rsquo;re keeping up with customer requests and that support isn&rsquo;t getting in the way of the sales cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the ability to create new dashboards at a moment&rsquo;s notice, users can quickly organize new information when the unexpected &ndash; such as a global pandemic &ndash; occurs.</p>
<p>One Zendesk customer is a state labor department that has been using Explore to create a customized COVID-19 response dashboard. For months, it&rsquo;s been tracking the hundreds of thousands of calls they&rsquo;re getting about unemployment requests related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very custom example, where they are tracking everything that relates to the unemployment calls due to COVID-19,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;Are they completing calls, or are calls failing? Are people leaving the call early because they&rsquo;re not getting answered soon enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The department is also noting which days have the highest number of calls so that they can anticipate staffing needs. And Explore is helping them track how the number of requests rises and falls over time.</p>
<p>That may be a highly unusual use case, but the moral is clear &#8211; data empowers you to tackle unprecedented problems.</p>
<h2>Measuring customer experience with robust charts and reporting options</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to just measure everything. You have to display that data in an intuitive, easy to digest format.</p>
<p>Explore has over 20 types of charts available, along with a chart recommendation feature that helps match your specific data to the best possible visualization.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Reporting charts in Zendesk Explore" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/reporting-chart-types-explore.png" /></p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re trying to see how data results trend over time. In that case, Explore will suggest charts with a left-to-right progression, such as a line, column, area, or sparkline chart. On the other hand, say you&rsquo;re directly comparing two or more categories. For those head-to-heads, a bar, dot, TreeMap, bubble pack, or Piktochart will be recommended.</p>
<p>Why so many choices? Because the right <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-data-visualization/">data visualizations</a> will make trends and patterns easier to identify. For example, you can gain a much clearer picture of your customer base with charts showing how they break down demographically, or why they&rsquo;re most likely to contact your company.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Customer conversations chart" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/customer-conversations-chart-explore.png" /></p>
<p>All the charts you build can quickly be added to a dashboard or shared with other colleagues. Explore makes it easy to generate automatic weekly reports that keep everyone updated on particularly vital metrics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the biggest thing that people do in Explore is use it to build a bunch of charts, add them to a dashboard, and schedule that out to folks on their team,&rdquo; explains Andrew.</p>
<p>Of course, it should be noted that Explore&rsquo;s reporting functions go beyond graphs. And they&rsquo;re not limited to customer analytics, either.</p>
<p>Explore can also provide greater insight into your own support team&rsquo;s success rate. Team and agent reporting lets you know whether your service reps are meeting certain benchmarks for support and how many tickets they&rsquo;re fielding on a regular basis.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Team and agent reporting" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/team-agent-reporting-explore.png" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy to create tables via templates, but also to customize them,&rdquo; Faure says. &ldquo;The data is easily manipulated, and we can create attributes on the fly, which allows me to create exactly the reports I need, all with a very fluid experience.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Gathering hundreds of insights in a matter of minutes</h2>
<p>Companies need tools that have sophisticated capabilities but are easy to use. Tools that give every user access to tons of metrics, dashboards, and data visualizations that help clarify all of that information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the pre-built analytics that we&rsquo;ve put in Explore are based on years of best practices,&rdquo; Andrew says. &ldquo;The fact that we allow customers to dive so deep into their data and customize their reporting really helps folks optimize their business.&rdquo;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most wonderful time of the year will look a bit different in 2020. The holidays are usually a time for parties with family and friends, wearing ugly sweaters, going to see The Nutcracker or taking beach vacations over the winter break. But with the pandemic still gripping the world, even Santa may have to practice social distancing. Traffic in brick-and-mortar stores is sure to be down, and economic uncertainty may mean reduced consumer spending. It’s also an election year, which creates more media and social noise for retailers to cut through.</p>
<p>What’s not uncertain is that the holiday season, typically November and December, is an important time for retailers. Sales can make up as much as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/holiday-spending-expected-to-rise-5percent-this-year-driven-by-online-sales.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">30 percent of a retailer’s annual revenue</a>. Some retail sectors have already been hit hard by the pandemic while others have fared well, but nearly all now face the task of figuring out how best to connect with customers and work outside standard staffing and inventory formulas.</p>
<p>“I do think it’s going to be a holiday season unlike any holiday season we’ve seen before given social distancing and masks and everything else,” Chip Bergh, chief executive of Levi Strauss &#038; Company, said in an interview with the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/retailers-holiday-shopping.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>. “There’s the combination of pandemic, which won’t be gone by this Christmas, and the economic fallout from it, which, who knows how bad it’s going to be by then?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some retail sectors have already been hit hard by the pandemic while others have fared well, but nearly all now face the task of figuring out how best to connect with customers and work outside standard staffing and inventory formulas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early holiday spending forecasts don’t sound promising: according to Brandwatch, <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/351984/an-empty-stocking-many-consumers-will-spend-less.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">44 percent of consumers</a> say they plan to spend less on gifts and holiday celebrations in 2020 compared to last year. At the same time, a July 2020 report from Forrester, “<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+State+Of+The+US+Shopper+COVID19/-/E-RES161256" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The state of the U.S. shopper — COVID-19</a>,” stated that “Fully 84 percent of U.S. online adults are buying the same amount or more online because of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>What this means is that it may be a tale of two customers—those who are needfully scaling back, and others who are saving money in areas like travel and dining and shifting their funds in new directions, towards things like home improvements or personal luxury items. For many retailers, the key to success may be how well they understand why people are purchasing the things that they are.</p>
<p>Based on emerging forecasts and recent research, here are three things that retailers need to be focused on this holiday season.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/retail-trends-2020/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5 trends from retail’s 2020 Big Show</a>]</em></p>
<h4>1. Boost the e-commerce experience</h4>
<p>The way people shop has changed over the course of the pandemic. Many Americans have moved online in hopes of avoiding crowds in stores, and retailers should encourage people to continue shopping online. Part of this is about giving customers more advance notice of sales or expanding promotion timelines beyond traditional sales periods like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day. The more flexibility customers have, the more they can buy when it works for them. The National Retail Federation’s (NRF) <a href="https://nrf.com/insights/holiday-and-seasonal-trends/winter-holidays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2020 forecast reports</a> that in a survey of 54 retailers, 74 percent believe the holiday season will be longer this year as customers spread out their purchases, and that holiday shopping will begin in October.</p>
<p>The best way to meet customer needs is to make sure the e-commerce experience is easy and seamless from purchase to after-sales support. Retailers will also need to be nimble and able to manage the supply chain so that inventory can be found, easily moved, and shipped to customers—whether that’s from a warehouse or an individual store.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For many retailers, the key to success may be how well they understand why people are purchasing the things that they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consumer patterns continue to evolve regardless of the pandemic. &#8220;Forty percent of U.S. online adults prioritize convenience and opt for products that reduce effort while enhancing speed and ease,&#8221; according to Forrester analysts in an August 2020 report: “<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Vast+Fast+And+Relentless+Consumer+Buying+Enters+A+New+Era/-/E-RES161439" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vast, Fast, And Relentless: Consumer Buying Enters A New Era.</a>”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Vast+Fast+And+Relentless+Consumer+Buying+Enters+A+New+Era/-/E-RES161439" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> went on to explain: &#8220;&#8230;But as buying options have evolved, consumers no longer need to trade off price, convenience, and emotional experience. Innovative new products, services, and delivery models now cater to all three at once. This has triggered five changes in consumer attitudes: Consumers are more willing to test new brands and products; rely on personal devices when transacting; expect seamless digital and physical experiences; are savvy when gathering information; and are motivated to seek out the best buying experience.&#8221; </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/reimagining-future-of-retail/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reimagining the future of retail</a>]</em></p>
<h4>2. Focus on customer service</h4>
<p>A spike in online orders comes with new challenges, like managing—and accounting or apologizing for—out of stock items and shipping delays. This is where customer service is key and proactive communication can go a long way. </p>
<p>As much as retailers can automate or make self-service available, so that customers can easily know or find out what’s happening with their order or return, will help them keep call center volume manageable. This requires having the right processes and data in place at the right time, and, ideally, the ability to provide real-time answers. If, for example, a customer reaches out to a centralized call center, will the support agent know the status of the customer’s curbside pickup at an individual store?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Some retailers may also want to think creatively about repurposing sales associates to connect with customers virtually or by phone. Ultimately, customer retention may be about a retailer’s ability to be there and listen, and to apologize when things don’t go right. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/d2c-retail-simple-customer-experience-just-need-right-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">D2C retail: Why a simple customer experience is just what we need right now</a>]</em></p>
<h4>3. Offer curbside pickup</h4>
<p>Although nearly two-thirds of retailers surveyed by the NRF <a href="https://nrf.com/insights/holiday-and-seasonal-trends/winter-holidays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expect all of their stores to be open</a> in October, November, and December, the pandemic makes it not only unlikely, but impossible, to pack stores in the same way as years past. So while ordering online for pickup in a store isn’t a new phenomenon, it’s become far more important for both customers and retailers. According to the NRF, many retailers <a href="https://nrf.com/blog/through-retail-lens-curbside-pickup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">were able to quickly stand up this service</a> early in 2020. Michaels craft store began offering curbside pickup for the first time, almost from the beginning of the pandemic, while other major retailers like Kohl’s expanded existing, but smaller programs. </p>
<p>For shoppers, curbside pickup offers convenience and safety. It also gives retailers another way to make sales and reduce the number of people in-store. For retailers that moved quickly on curbside pickup, or are offering it for the first time, heavier holiday volume may pressure-test a store’s capabilities on whether the staffing and inventory flow can meet customer expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, customer retention may be about a retailer&#8217;s ability to be there and listen, and to apologize when things don&#8217;t go right. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Agility is required</h4>
<p>Research tells us that <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">good good customer experiences can create loyalty</a>—and a bad customer experience can easily drive shoppers to a competitor. With heightened anxiety and the weirdness of a socially distanced holiday season, the pressure to get the customer experience right is as heavy as ever. </p>
<p>It may be a time for making seismic in the way things work—for both the short- and long-term. And when it comes to creative solutions like curbside pickup, consider that Santa, after all, has been making chimney-side deliveries before it was cool. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &ldquo;Pareto principle&rdquo; holds that 80% of your revenue comes from just 20% of your customers.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s probably not the <em>exact</em> ratio for your business. It would honestly be kind of strange if <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">an Italian economist</a> who died 100 years ago had accurately predicted your company&rsquo;s precise revenue results.</p>
<p>However, the fact remains that not all customers contribute equally to your profitability&mdash;some spend more than others.</p>
<p>Customer segmentation is the process of categorizing your clients to understand how certain groups of buyers relate to your business. Segmentation can reveal a lot about your customers&mdash;including which ones add the most to your company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Need help putting a name to the 20% of your customers who are doing 80% of the spending, give or take? Read on to learn how to identify your most valuable customer segments, understand their relationship with your business, and find ways to keep the customer happy.</p>
<h2>Tag customers by their segment traits</h2>
<p>To identify valuable segments, you first need to figure out which customer characteristics and behaviors you want to use for your classifications. The more traits you track, the more ways you&rsquo;ll be able to segment your customer data.</p>
<p>There are many qualities you can look at when identifying and grouping customers. Some of the most common customer segment examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographic: </strong>Analyzing customers by their cities, states, countries, or regions.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic: </strong>Segmenting customers by age, gender, income, education, occupation, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Industry:</strong> Organizing clients based on their field of business.</li>
<li><strong>Company size:</strong> Identifying SMB (small/medium business), SME (small/medium enterprise), and enterprise-level clients.</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencollet/">Ben Collet</a>, Zendesk&rsquo;s Senior Director of Customer Advocacy, has also found that <strong>time-based parameters</strong> can be a great way of identifying customers. Ben&rsquo;s team started segmenting customers by how long they&rsquo;d been using Zendesk&rsquo;s product, from those still in the 14-day trial period to veteran clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ended up standing out to us was the first 90 days,&rdquo; Ben says. &ldquo;That timespan segment had relevance to all of our customer types, big and small, and contained investment opportunities that were also relevant to prospect conversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided on your classifications, define these segments in your customer service software. Using a platform like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/">Zendesk Support</a> makes it easy to access and update all of the information you have on a customer. Start by <a target="_blank" href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662006-Adding-tags-to-users-and-organizations">putting ticket tags</a> on all of your clients, whether they&rsquo;re individuals or organizations. </p>
<p>Try updating all of your contacts to have an &ldquo;SMB,&rdquo; &ldquo;SME,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; tag added to segment support tickets by company size. For time-based segmentation, use daily syncs of data with your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/platform/">CRM system</a> to tag the customer&rsquo;s age as &ldquo;First90,&rdquo; &ldquo;FirstYear&rdquo; or &ldquo;Veteran.&rdquo; And if your CRM doesn&rsquo;t already capture it, you can also tag demographic and geographic segment information.</p>
<p>Tagging specific characteristics also serves other purposes beyond segmentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use tags to route these customers to aligned agents, cluster macros for the right size customer, build personalized self-service experiences based on ticket trends from that group, and set service-level agreements for response times,&rdquo; recommends Ben. </p>
<h2>Filter customer segments by their value</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve started tagging customers, you&rsquo;re able to identify which segments drive the most value for your company.</p>
<p>There are different ways to gauge a specific customer segment&rsquo;s value to your business. Retailers, e-commerce stores, and other non-subscription-based companies might analyze each segment&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/average-order-value/">average order value (AOV)</a> or their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/customer-lifetime-value-ltv/">customer lifetime value (LTV)</a>.</p>
<p>SaaS companies, on the other hand, will most likely look at a segment&rsquo;s average annual recurring revenue, or ARR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might use a CRM as a source of truth to house ARR,&rdquo; says Ben. If your CRM contains both segment tags and revenue numbers, you&rsquo;ll be able to filter customer segments to look at their overall value.</p>
<p>Ben also recommends that support teams work closely with their go-to-market partners and look at the segments that they&rsquo;re already monitoring as valuable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a data team, they might be already positioning universal customer segment definitions and terms for the whole company to adopt,&rdquo; Ben says. &ldquo;At the very least, it gives you criteria to test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your sales team always talks about your top 100 or 10,000 customers, take a look at tickets from that candidate segment and see if a story emerges,&rdquo; adds Ben. &ldquo;If your customer satisfaction (CSAT) for this group is below all other groups, you might have a useful definition of an enterprise customer segment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your most valuable segments are subject to change over time. As your company grows, new opportunities will emerge and you may begin prioritizing different segments.</p>

</div>
<p>Your startup may become more widely known, opening up new markets. An industry you cater to may shrink, causing you to pivot to other verticals.</p>
<p>When Zendesk started out, we were targeting the enterprise customer segment. But over time, we began to see more and more opportunities with smaller businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was clear from their ticket data and customer lifetime value performance that SMB customers had less complex use cases, and wanted to be able to have answers as quickly as possible&mdash;even faster than humans could be available on any channel to provide,&rdquo; Ben explains.</p>
<p>Recognizing that smaller businesses had a need for low complexity and high-speed support, we decided to invest in <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/guide/features/#features">our self-service</a> and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/">Answer Bot</a> resources for this segment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think what&rsquo;s most important here is the recognition that the most valuable customer segment definition will change over time, that customer segments have a shelf life, and that you should move as swiftly as possible to make relevant investments in their support experiences so you can keep pace with your customer growth,&rdquo; says Ben.</p>
<h2>Evaluate your service for valuable customer segments</h2>
<p>Once customers are classified in your support tool, it&rsquo;s easier to check customer service metrics for specific segments to make sure you&rsquo;re providing excellent support.</p>
<p>But which key performance indicators should you look at?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are absolutely universal baselines from which to understand any segment,&rdquo; says Ben. &ldquo;These are the same KPIs we all use to understand support experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those table-stakes metrics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer satisfaction (CSAT)</li>
<li>Net promoter score (NPS)</li>
<li>First reply time</li>
<li>Time to resolution</li>
<li>Complexity, or average agent touches</li>
<li>Average number of requests per month</li>
</ul>
<p>Zendesk Support tracks all of the above. That allows you to bring the data into <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/">Zendesk Explore</a> to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-segmentation-analytics/">monitor and analyze</a> these metrics for your most valuable segments.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Average time spent per ticket report" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/explore-average-time-spent-per-ticket.png" /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the baselines, you can use Explore to monitor and analyze more qualitative service metrics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top contact reasons (maybe by product area)</li>
<li>Disposition</li>
<li>Customer sentiment</li>
<li>Resolution type</li>
<li>Percentage of escalations</li>
<li>Retention, expansion, churn, and contraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore lets you set up dashboards and automated reporting that will keep you updated on the most critical KPIs for your most critical customer segments.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Explore dashboard" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/dashboard-explore.png" /></p>
<p>If you see that one of your segments is underperforming in a key metric, you can then act quickly to identify and fix the underlying issue.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say customers in the first 90 days of using your service are one of your most valuable segments. If you&rsquo;re using Explore to monitor that group, you might see a spike in support tickets from them on your dashboard. You can then analyze all &ldquo;First90&rdquo; support tickets to see if there&rsquo;s a frequently asked question that needs to be proactively addressed. Or, your ticket analysis may reveal a recurring product issue that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Regularly monitoring service metrics for your most valuable customer segments will continually reveal areas for improvement. And when it comes to satisfying and retaining your most lucrative customers, there&rsquo;s <em>always</em> room for improvement.</p>
<h2>Reap the benefits of customer segmentation and analysis</h2>
<p>The rationale for focusing on your most valuable customer segments is to make sure you&rsquo;re taking care of your best customers. But customer segmentation has a way of making things better for lower-priority segments, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By being able to show where your team is creating growth with customers in some segments, it can highlight how to apply those lessons to segments who need more care,&rdquo; Ben says. &ldquo;By constantly prioritizing high-impact opportunities by segment, you are raising the standard of service incrementally and faster than you might for all customers all at once.&rdquo;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“The future of work is often presented as a binary choice: a hunger game between organic and silicon cognition that results in either a dystopian nightmare in which humans fight for the last jobs not taken by robots or an nearly inconceivable utopia where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, yet we bask in the leisure and self-expression afforded our newfound time free from work.”</em></p>
<p>Tucked in the middle of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-adaptation-advantage-let-go-learn-fast-and-thrive-in-the-future-of-work/9781119653097" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Adaptation Advantage: Let Go, Learn Fast, and Thrive in the Future of Work</a></em> the above sentence describes two opposing beliefs about where we’re headed—where all this accelerated social, technological, and economic change is taking us. Authors Heather E. McGowan and Chris Shipley, (and the forward by Thomas L. Friedman), explain that the reality is far more complex and interesting than either of these options. In fact, the two concepts above are kind of based on the old, linear paradigm that things go in one direction: from birth to death. Robots will take over the earth and everything humans have come to identify as themselves, and their purpose, will be erased. And who will we be then?</p>
<p><em>The Adaptation Advantage</em> explains that the way change happens, driven by technology and social adjustment, is much more like real life in that humans are constantly changing—even from being babies to children to teens to adults, and so on. We don’t have the same bodies we had a few years ago, the same knowledge base, the same understanding. We add and drop things in a perpetual progression, just like the evolution of technology. And just like technology, we’re not only moving in one direction; we’re moving in many—and through our work, our play, our relationships, we’re redefining what we believe is meaningful. Now we just have to learn to embrace that reality rather than clinging to the idea we’re like a train on a track.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We add and drop things in a perpetual progression, just like the evolution of technology. And just like technology, we&#8217;re not only moving in one direction; we&#8217;re moving in many&mdash;and through our work, our play, our relationships, we&#8217;re redefining what we believe is meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Making the argument for abandoning your old identity</h4>
<p>Today, the idea of learning, working, retiring is something that happens continuously in “flows” of knowledge, the authors explain. One great example was of an educator they interviewed who said he didn’t know what he would do outside of academia. The writers were shocked.</p>
<p>“Will had exercised tremendous skills through a wide array of challenges,” including negotiating through teachers’ strikes, helping a school recover and move forward from a fire that damaged the buildings, managing public relations, mentoring students…. “Any of these skills are transferable to hundreds of jobs that would never have ‘educator’ in the job description,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Most of us are like this educator. We see our education and our various job titles rather than seeing all the various skill sets and knowledge bases that comprise that job. We think we’re a puzzle that only goes together one way. The authors encourage readers to, in a sense, pick their job history apart for these components and find out what new thing, new expertise or job they can create if they combine these talents and skills in a different way. So a project manager might be a negotiator, an analyst, a planner, a logistics expert, a salesperson&#8230;and so on. They might find a new role that emphasizes one of these aspects they’re really good at and enjoy, that is a totally different job title. And then, in a few years, when the world changes again, they can take their new experiences and skills and redesign themselves again. This is what it means to adapt, and it comes with a lot of freedom and creativity. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/bright-future-generalists-workplace/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The bright future of generalists in the workplace</a>]</em></p>
<p>The authors explain how deeply ingrained it is in our society to identify with our profession, and that the loss of a job can cause even greater trauma than the loss of a loved one. Our identity—and often career choice—is shaped by our family, gender, race, community…. What kind of work your parents and neighbors had will probably direct your idea of your own career, often closing out a lot of possibilities. We expect small children to label themselves when we ask, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” and we don’t accept the answers of “a unicorn” or “a gorilla” as valid. After toddlerhood, the pressure to identify oneself with one’s profession never eases up. We associate all kinds of attributes to someone who is, say, a journalist, a massage therapist, a chef, a doctor…. Historically, once we’ve launched on a trajectory, we must cling to it for dear life or risk everything. McGowan and Shipley acknowledge and explain these narratives and then gently, but firmly, encourage readers to abandon them.</p>

<p>One great difference between <em>The Adaptation Advantage</em> and similar books is that it doesn’t treat those who struggle to accept this way of thinking as casualties of evolution. Instead it offers practical steps to ease the change. Speaking of the “Deaths of Despair” of older, largely white men from drug addiction and suicide, the authors note, “If you are not well prepared to participate in a changing labor market and if your social status is being reshaped by changing demographic and gender norms, how can you be comfortable in the vulnerability required to learn and adapt?”</p>
<p>They encourage readers that humans do not peak at some age and then begin to decline, but that, as MIT researchers discovered, people peak in multiple ways and at any number of ages.</p>

<h4>5 tips for embracing change</h4>
<p>Adapting to change has a lot to do with our attitude. Here are a few reminders from McGowan and Shipley about how we can adjust our perspective when facing change.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every day is a new day.</strong> Think of it like the first day of school, new clothes on, pencils sharpened. This is going to be exciting: “That idea—that every day is a new learning day—is at the heart of the adaptation advantage.”  </li>
<li><strong>Always be looking for the next wave.</strong> Disrupt yourself by challenging yourself to learn something new; don’t wait for circumstances to disrupt you. </li>
<li><strong>Recognize that your identity is a story someone told you about yourself.</strong> Is it true? Is there another story you’d like to tell? Another part of the narrative unexplored? Know that your identity is in your own hands. </li>
<li><strong>You are not a finished product.</strong> You are instead a prototype in continual development. </li>
<li><strong>Humans have a leg up in adapting.</strong> Social and emotional intelligence, creativity, communication, judgement, sensemaking, and empathy are all fundamental to the adaptation advantage&#8230;and robots don’t have them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Getting comfortable with change means taking new approaches</h4>
<p>The authors’ personal histories are wonderful parables about how the principles of no longer defining yourself by your job title and reinventing yourself as things change can unfold. Their stories include failure, vulnerability, recovery, experimentation, and growth. But the authors go beyond their personal journeys and also address the role of educational systems, societies, organizations, and leaders in facilitating, rather than obstructing, this transformation. Traditional educational systems, they note, are often far too eager to help someone into a work identity that they’ll struggle to shift from if it becomes necessary. The authors point to some progressive educational systems that offer more innovative approaches, such as experiential teaching in which people learn about themselves, their skills and their likes, through project-based learning, rather than just pedagogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They encourage readers that humans do not peak at some age and then begin to decline, but that, as MIT researchers discovered, people peak in multiple ways and at any number of ages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also employers that go out of their way to help people cross-train in different departments, upskill, and evolve. AT&#038;T offers a “career intelligence” dashboard that shows available jobs, required skills, salary range, and job demand outlook. Or, the authors note, a bank that is shedding accountants might retrain them as cybersecurity analysts. But these types of programs are still somewhat avant garde.</p>

<h4>An encyclopedia of change</h4>
<p>I once was given a book called <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> that not only had hundreds of classic French recipes, but it explained what things like aspic were and where they came from, and the history of the food, etc. <em>The Adaptation Advantage</em> reminded me of it. This book is nearly a narrative encyclopedia of social, technological, and workplace change over the past 100 or more years. </p>
<p>The reader does run into cairns of wisdom that seem a little worn if you’ve been to every SXSW conference or are well-versed in books on the startup world. For that crowd, the <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve Jobs commencement speech</a> about getting fired from Apple, or Simon Sinek’s “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Power of Why</a>” TED talk about how people don’t buy <em>what</em> you do, they buy <em>why</em> you do it, will read as familiar anecdotes. There’s also the story of the three bricklayers and how they each viewed their jobs differently. These are classic guideposts that remind us that we’re human and that, at the heart of all this technology and change, are our dreams and feelings. We don’t lose these when we adapt; they’re at our core. </p>

</div>
<p>Instagram has changed the way customers form relationships with brands. Instagram is mostly seen as a medium for consuming media, creating content, shopping, or on the business side of things, a funky marketing tool. Messaging isn&#8217;t often part of the conversation, but it&#8217;s a huge part of the experience.</p>
<p>For businesses with heavy Millennial and Gen Z customer bases, Instagram is crucial. And yet the features that make shopping, sharing, and chatting easy for Instagram users are usually only discussed in the context of smaller retailers, restaurants, and lifestyle brands. That’s about to change.</p>
<p>The Messenger API with support for Instagram, which is <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2020/10/19/say-%F0%9F%91%8B-to-api-support-for-instagram-messaging/">now available</a> through select partners, is a tool that will help businesses conduct conversations at scale — and the implications of this are huge.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">How Instagram for business worked without the API</h2>
<p>Consider the fact that until now, Nike, the most followed brand on Instagram, could not respond to your DMs. Despite a prolific presence on social media, messaging on Instagram wasn’t feasible for a brand that big.</p>
<p>SMBs traditionally managed their conversations using the Instagram Direct inbox (directly in the app or browser) or through the Facebook Business Suite’s unified inbox, which displayed Instagram DMs alongside Facebook Messenger conversations. This also may have called for a dedicated support role, separate from conversations happening on other channels like WhatsApp, email, or voice. Otherwise, businesses who couldn’t manage high volumes of messages would have to abandon messaging on Instagram altogether.</p>
<p>Facebook has a two-tiered strategy when it comes to business messaging. One for SMBs — which birthed tools like the Facebook Business Suite and the WhatsApp Business app, making it possible for small businesses to track customer comments and conversations with light analytics and low overhead, and a separate strategy for enterprise businesses — say hi to the Facebook Business, WhatsApp Business, and Messenger APIs.</p>
<div id="section-2" class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>What is an API?</h3>
<p>API stands for <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>. In the world of business messaging, APIs allow enterprise businesses to do more with their customer conversations. They can be turned into support tickets, be used as a source for data, and be integrated into their own CRM software. It also means companies can have multiple agents balancing a greater amount of conversations while leveraging tools like chatbots. All of this is at the forefront of modern customer experiences, but until now, Instagram has mostly steered clear from the API pie.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="section-3">Keeping Instagram business conversations together</h2>
<p>Keeping conversations separate poses a problem: Customer conversations are a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/conversational-business/">valuable source of insight</a>. When Instagram behavior and messages can be understood in the full context of the customer’s relationship with the brand, the brand can benefit by providing better service while leveraging that data. And since Instagram’s solution also doesn’t allow for automation, agents can’t deflect queries to the right inbox or deflect frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>In October 2020, Facebook finally started making good on its promise to cobble together the backends of Instagram Direct and Messenger, making it possible to send messages to users across both platforms. Over the past couple of years, Instagram released a flurry of e-commerce features, like Shop and Checkout, so brands can easily sell products in the app. The success of WhatsApp’s Business API, which was released in 2018, had people feeling as though it was only a matter of time before Instagram joined the business messaging fold.</p>
<p>Messaging has clearly worked for SMBs on Instagram. With users already primed to research, shop, and comment, they are already forming relationships with brands. A scalable messaging solution — one that doesn’t require a separate inbox or separate agents — for bigger brands and companies has been the only missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">The Instagram business messaging solution</h2>
<p>The Messenger API for Instagram is designed with these problems in mind. It addresses the issues that larger companies have been struggling with, allowing them to manage customer conversations and offer support in conversations started on Instagram. Similar to its WhatsApp and Messenger-focussed predecessors, the API will make it possible for enterprise clients and brands that are already using Instagram — and let’s be real, they totally are — to manage high volumes of conversations.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h4><strong>The Messenger API for Instagram</strong> allows larger companies to enhance their business presence on Instagram while offering better support and managing customer conversations at scale.</h4>
</div>
<p>Instagram’s messaging has some pretty cool, rich features that businesses haven’t really been able to use until now — whether this looks like offering more personal touches with emoji reactions, or threading conversations for clarity. The door is also open to more complex conversational use cases, which can include chatbots and data capture. Most importantly, the Messenger API for Instagram makes it possible for businesses to manage conversations initiated by people from profiles, Shops, and Stories.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">What businesses using Instagram means for conversational commerce</h2>
<p>Instagram’s scalable messaging solution goes far beyond support. It’s part of the changing face of conversational commerce. Rather than imagining conversational commerce as converting leads in chat, or using live chat while online shopping, or even establishing a brand presence in messaging apps (a great start, but arguably not enough!), it can be better understood as part of the greater customer relationship.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>What is conversational commerce?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/online-retailers-transforming-customer-experience-conversational-commerce/">Conversational commerce</a> is how messaging interacts with e-commerce. Customers want to ask questions, conduct research, and get support — and according to research by Facebook, 75% of these shoppers actually make a purchase.</p>
</div>
<p>When it comes to online shopping, Instagram has changed the game. YouTube creators make video hauls showing products they bought on Instagram, suggesting novelty, but mainstream brands have hopped on the train too. Features like Checkout and shoppable tags bring shopping straight to the app experience.</p>
<p>Millennial-loved brands like Outdoor Voices and Glossier are truly Instagram-first, but before the Messenger API, scaling meant they basically outgrew their inboxes.</p>
<p>Instagram users — especially those who shop — offer a lot of insight into the brands they interact with, whether by bookmarking posts, tagging brands, sharing branded content, or sliding into their DMs. Now bigger brands can finally offer <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/home-bound-customers-turn-to-messaging/">messaging as part of a holistic customer experience</a>. 81% of Instagram users are already doing research on products and services in-app — how might this change now that they can actually chat with the big brands they’re interested in?</p>

<p>A sales process is a series of steps a salesperson takes to build a business relationship that ends in a sale. Every time a rep takes replicable, consistent action toward making a sale, they&rsquo;re following a sales process.</p>
<p>High-performing sales teams often follow an established process. Managers enforce it through sales-rep training and coaching. They use digital tools to power lead generation, opportunity-tracking, pipeline management, and customer communication.</p>

<p>A successful sales process framework has five main phases:</p>

<div class="row">
<ol class="list-num-circle list-2-col">
<li>
<h3>Prospecting</h3>
<p>Sourcing new leads and potential buyers. During the prospecting phase, sales and marketing teams collaborate to connect with prospective customers, or leads. Prospecting requires thorough research on target customers to understand their pain points and their decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Qualifying</h3>
<p>Learning about specific customer needs and matching them with potential offerings. In this stage, sales reps often consult directly with prospective customers to better understand their buying process and requirements. Reps also identify key decision-makers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Presenting</h3>
<p>Introducing the offering to the prospect. The presenting phase typically involves direct communications and interactions between sales teams and prospective customers. Sales and marketing teams must work together to craft the right messaging in order to earn the trust of potential buyers. Customer communications should address any concerns that leads have about the offering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Finalizing the deal. Closing a sale involves addressing any final concerns and confirming the details that will ultimately cause the customer to buy. This can often mean adjusting pricing, proposing a plan, or negotiating the terms of a contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Following up</h3>
<p>Staying in touch with the customer. The follow-up phase is key to maintaining long-term relationships that translate into more revenue. Once a sale is finalized, it&rsquo;s important for sales teams to continue the conversation even beyond handoff to customer support.</p>

<h2>The B2B sales process</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<p>The fundamental stages of the sales process don&rsquo;t change, but the way they&rsquo;re put into practice can change based on several factors, including your industry.</p>
<p>B2B sales methodologies focus on identifying and reaching qualified decision-makers within companies and building long-term business relationships that grow over time. The success of the B2B sales process hinges on the depth of research reps perform to uncover opportunities. Many B2B sales depend on more than one team working together across companies to make deals happen:</p>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<ol class="list-num-circle list-2-col">
<li>
<h4>Prospecting: Finding the right decision-makers</h4>
<p>B2B sales reps interact with as many as 10 people in a buying group&mdash;all of whom inform on decision-making&mdash;to make a sale. B2B sales methodologies offer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.troops.ai/blog/meddic-vs-meddpic-vs-meddpicc">a way to quickly identify and qualify the best prospects</a> and turn them into leads and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Qualifying: Asking the right questions</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s imperative that B2B reps understand the buying process and requirements of each of their target accounts. B2B sales teams use aforementioned sales methodologies to help them ask the right questions to gather data. It also helps sales teams to determine if a prospective customer is a good fit for their offerings&mdash; if they discover that the company isn&rsquo;t a good match, it&rsquo;s best to pursue other, better qualified opportunities. After a prospect is fully qualified, a rep can make smart recommendations and anticipate any roadblocks to purchasing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Presenting: Keeping the conversation going</h4>
<p>Once they reach the right contacts, B2B teams need to come up with the right messaging to gain buy-in from other decision-makers and sell the product. These communications can happen over multiple conversations, meetings, and follow-ups at every stage of the process. Keeping track of customer communications is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Closing: Partnering across teams</h4>
<p>Depending on the product or service, the closing stage may involve bringing in an implementation team to discuss rollout. If it&rsquo;s a major deal that could impact the entire company, the sales team may need to get executive leadership involved to iron out the details. The more directly involved other customer teams are in the sales process, the less confusion there will be once the sale is finalized. Plus, collaboration across teams means<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/two-ingredients-for-successful-b2b-sales-agility-and-stability"> rapid decisions</a> that help speed up the sales cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Following up: Building long-term relationships</h4>
<p>Closing a deal is just the beginning of a business relationship. B2B sales reps often work with customers beyond the initial sale to help prove the return on the customer&rsquo;s investment. Successful B2B customer relationships result in more revenue from upselling. That&rsquo;s why <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/personalize-outreach-scale-sales-engagement-automation/">following up and requesting referrals</a> is an important (and often overlooked) stage of the B2B sales process.</p>

<div class="col col-small-6">
<p>In 2020, sales teams who are used to selling in-person are facing a new reality: remote selling. Masterful live sales presenters suddenly have to work their magic via Zoom. Field reps who thrived on face-to-face encounters with customers now struggle with isolation as the reps work from home.</p>
<p>Besides the massive shifts in logistics and operations, sales organizations have realigned their product positioning and focus on customer needs. In the space of a few months, reps have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.troops.ai/webinar/unfreezing-pipeline-vendr">dramatically shifted their strategies and messaging</a> to keep customer conversations going.</p>
<p>All this sudden change can be disorienting for seasoned outside sales reps. A clear sales process gives your team a consistent routine to stick to during uncertain times.</p>
<p>A Zoom presentation may feel different from pitching in a conference room, but it&rsquo;s still part of the presentation phase of the sales process. Hashing out the details of a contract may now happen via Slack instead of in an office, but it&rsquo;s still part of the closing stage. Your sales process is like a tool kit that you equip your reps with that they can use in times of emergency.</p>

<h2>4 tactics for creating a sales process that&rsquo;s easy to adopt</h2>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<p>There&rsquo;s no one right sales process. What matters is how you communicate the process to your team and how easy your process is to adopt.</p>
<p>Create a sales process that makes sense for your team by using the following tactics:</p>
</p></div>

<h3>Examine what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Before you establish a new sales process or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://optimoroute.com/process-efficiency/">improve your existing process efficiency</a>, take an honest look at what your team is already doing:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Talk with your reps.</strong> Review the last few months of deals with your team. Discuss how long it took to close the deals and what factors led to the customers&rsquo; decisions to buy (or what got in the way of lost/stalled deals).</p>

<h3>Align your sales process with your target customer&rsquo;s needs</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>For results-driven sales reps, there&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than when internal bureaucracies get in the way of a deal moving forward. If your company treats your sales process like a one-size-fits-all model for meeting business operations goals (i.e. paperwork and data entry), you risk having complicated procedures.</p>
<p>To avoid stalled-out deals, keep your sales process focused on delivering positive outcomes to customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Build buyer personas.</strong> Create an avatar for the types of buyers your sales team interacts with. Each buyer has a different pain point, expectation, and buying motivation. Your team can refer to buyer personas when creating strategies for prospecting and driving the creation of relevant messaging.</p>
<p><em>Learn more about creating buyer personas: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/15275657-how-to-build-buyer-personas-for-better-marketing">How to Build a Buyer Persona for Better Marketing</a></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Map the buyer journey.</strong> Use customer interviews and surveys to understand the steps that lead them to purchasing your products or services. Compare your sales-process map and buyer&rsquo;s journey map: Are there gaps between your sales reps tasks and your customers&rsquo; needs? When you identify those gaps, start brainstorming ways to bridge them for your customers.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognize buying signals during customer interactions.</strong> <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/features/voice-of-the-customer-tools/">Understand and document how customers indicate</a> that they&rsquo;re ready to move from one stage of the decision-making process to the next. Coach your team on recognizing those signals in discovery calls so they can move deals along more effectively. Additionally, set up automated marketing systems to send communications that push the sale forward when these signals occur.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop buyer enablement materials.</strong> Sales enablement materials are great, but it&rsquo;s hard to sell something if your customer finds the buying process intimidating or overwhelming. In addition to product-focused marketing materials, equip your sales team with buyer-enablement content, such as purchasing guides, product comparisons, and information about financing.</p>

<h3>Communicate your sales process across your organization</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>It&rsquo;s important that your team know the steps they need to take to consistently close deals. It&rsquo;s just as important that your entire company know the processes you have in place to ensure that your sales team is delivering on revenue goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Invite other teams to collaborate.</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/11/15-sales-statistics.html">Nearly three-quarters of sales teams</a> report that interdepartmental collaboration is absolutely critical to their overall sales process. It helps give your team complete visibility into all the phases of their customers&rsquo; journeys. Customer-facing teams such as support and marketing will know when to pass a customer to sales, and internal teams will be ready to help out with potential deals.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document your process.</strong> Make it easy for people to find answers to questions about selling in your organization by creating a<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tettra.com/article/sales-documentation/"> knowledge base.</a> This will act as a central library that new hires and existing team members can turn to when they&rsquo;re unsure about how to follow processes.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep everyone updated.</strong> Break communication silos by celebrating wins and sharing new knowledge in company-wide channels. Send a monthly sales newsletter to brief other teams on important goings-on. If you&rsquo;re working remotely, use a virtual sales gong to alert the team about new deals. These updates give your reps the recognition they need to stay motivated. It also helps other teams keep their fingers on the pulse of your team&rsquo;s hard work. The more connected teams are across your org, the more investment they&rsquo;ll have in each other&rsquo;s success.</p>

<h3>Optimize your sales process tools</h3>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Consider how your current tech stack is helping your team move through each stage of the sales process. If it feels more like your team is serving the needs of your tech stack, it&rsquo;s time to find a better system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborate with your IT group.</strong> Before you go shopping for major technology, talk through your sales process with your IT team. Discuss what goals you have and what your current infrastructure can support. You may discover that your tech people can solve problems/streamline processes with tools you already have.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate with your vendors.</strong> If you already have a platform in place, your vendor&rsquo;s customer success team may be able to help you discover more efficient ways to use your current tech. You may uncover products specifically designed to help automate stages where your team is struggling.</li>
<li><strong>Look for tools designed with the end user in mind.</strong> Find a tool that can integrate easily with your existing systems and with an interface that your reps intuitively know how to use.</li>
</ul></div>

</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<p>Ultimately, your approach to delivering customer outcomes and team communications will be the driving factor behind your sales process. If you listen to customers and share knowledge with your team, you&rsquo;ll be able to create a clear process that your sales team can rally around.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;re building your sales process, always keep in mind who you&rsquo;re building it for: your customers.</p>
<p>High-performing sales teams look to customer expectations to inform their processes. The best sales processes are equally focused on delivering on customer needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The customer has changed and so have their expectations on what customer experience means to them. As these expectations change, so must the company and their approach to customer experience.</p>
<p>There was a time when hyper-personalization and chatbots were the leading methods to engage with customers. Today, customers are looking for a very different approach that addresses two key attributes: Access to information and speed to resolution. On top of it all, customers want an experience that identifies with them regardless of the means or department they engage with.</p>
<h2>Removing the fragmented customer experience</h2>
<p>Customers will engage with a company in many ways and through different channels. They may use a mobile application or speak with a customer service representative. Likewise, they may engage through marketing, sales, or social media. Regardless of how they engage or the department they engage with, the customer is still working with the same company and expects a degree of connectedness behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Over time, it is common for the customer&rsquo;s experience to be a mishmash of disjointed interactions with little continuity. Any given customer may be connected through a loyalty program or support agreement, but little else. In the advent of regulatory, compliance and privacy requirements, the customer may even be reduced to a simple number. But from the customer&rsquo;s perspective, they are the same person at every touch point &mdash; and it&rsquo;s important for the company to recognize that.</p>
<p>Customers are looking for a seamless experience across the entire customer journey &mdash; and each customer may take a different journey. The information they provided in one scenario should carry to the next experience. The silos of disjointed systems in the past can&rsquo;t keep up, and companies need to rely on a more integrated approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The silos of disjointed systems in the past can&rsquo;t keep up, and companies need to rely on a more integrated approach.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The integrated approach needs to support an omnichannel customer that may first engage via chatbot, then switch to a live person only to follow up with email. All the while, the information about the customer and their inquiry are quickly following a path to resolution.</p>
<h2>Access to information</h2>
<p>The customer, those supporting the customer, and those systems with which the customer and agent engage need to have immediate access to relevant information. While that sounds relatively straightforward, for many companies it requires crisscrossing a number of system integrations. Accomplishing that is rarely seamless or speedy.</p>
<p>Chatbots are a common way for customers to engage with a company, as they can quickly solve common questions leveraging machine learning and automation. But is the chatbot programmed in a way that actually addresses the customer&rsquo;s inquiry? And what if the question goes beyond the chatbot&rsquo;s capability&mdash;will the system automatically identify the challenge and hand off the conversation to a live agent? Does each involved party have the context and access to backend information they need?</p>
<p>This is where integrated systems come into play. <strong>Integrated systems that understand the customer journey and support an omnichannel experience provide ready access to automation, like chatbots, and to support agents.</strong> In the end, the information is accessible for everyone who needs it, whether it&rsquo;s the customer, the agent, or the company.</p>
<h2>Speed to resolution</h2>
<p>Access to information is one thing. Speed to resolution is another. Customers are expecting immediate resolution of their question or issue. Ironically, technology often gets in the way.</p>
<p>Slow websites, poor search capabilities, interactive voice response (IVR), phone trees, and conditioned response chatbots are only a few of the ways that technology can exacerbate the problem. How many times have you needed to navigate a phone tree that ultimately did not have an option for the issue you were calling about? Or engage with a chatbot that misunderstood your issue? These are just a few frustrating examples we can all relate to. In addition, it is too easy for customers to switch to a competitor after a bad experience, and prioritizing speed to resolution can help avoid this.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is too easy for customers to switch to a competitor after a bad experience, and prioritizing speed to resolution can help avoid this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why modern customer engagement systems are important. Unlike the patchwork systems of the past, these modern systems start with the customer experience and work from there. In doing so, they are oriented with the customer first, then engage the appropriate backend systems that best address the issue in the way the customer wants.</p>
<p>A modern approach to customer experience, with solid processes that account for the customer&rsquo;s perspective is powerful. Integrating your customers&rsquo; preferred channels, keeping information accessible, and employing a philosophy that keeps them at the center is a surefire way to keep your customers happy. Customer experience is a key differentiator, and at the end of the day, better CX means your customers will stick around &mdash; and have good things to say about you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new rules for customer service outsourcing in a changing world</p>
<p>Customer service teams have seen an unprecedented level of disruption this year. Some have had <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesks-benchmark-snapshot-impact-covid-19-cx/">surges in ticket volume</a>, while others have seen business plummet. Agents have to do more with less, all while they&rsquo;re adjusting to working from home.</p>
<p>Regardless of your specific situation, you may be considering customer service outsourcing as a potential solution. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://peaksupport.io">Peak Support</a> is a customer service outsourcing firm focused on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.peaksupport.io/services/customer-service/">servicing</a> high-growth companies. In the last six months, we&rsquo;ve seen companies turn to outsourcing to handle backlogs that developed because of supply chain disruption; handle surges in ticket volume due to growing demand.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking to outsource customer service, you have to know how your outsourcer has weathered this storm, and how it will weather the inevitable disruptions that are still to come. It&rsquo;s critical that your outsourcing partner provides excellent service &#8211; customers who have a bad experience are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238104">4x more likely to go to a competitor.</a> So, how do you know what customer service outsourcing company is right for you? And how do you know if they can handle your needs in this new landscape?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve published a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://info.peaksupport.io/guides/how-to-outsource-customer-support?_ga=2.51014570.2003742099.1602596200-436961846.1601652980">complete guide on outsourcing customer service</a>, which can help you answer many of these questions. In this article, we focus on four questions you can ask to get the information you need, as well as some answers that may show they&rsquo;re a good fit.</p>
<h2>How well have they adapted to a work-from-home environment?</h2>
<p>Almost <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/06/29/snapshot-new-working-home-economy/">42% of the US workforce is working from home</a> up from less than 5% previously, which has brought some new challenges. Just like everyone else, outsourcing companies have had to make adjustments so they&rsquo;re still able to provide quality service with remote customer service agents and remote call centers.</p>
<p>Some outsource customer service companies, including Peak Support, were already partially, or fully, remote. Having that set up meant they experienced less disruption, and were better-equipped to handle the changing landscape. However, for companies operating solely out of physical locations, such as call centers, making the change has been far more disruptive.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t have a home requirement before, they may have needed to scramble to get remote customer service agents in place and make sure things like technology and security requirements were met before continuing service. Though many may have figured it out in the meantime, it&rsquo;s good to know how it went previously just in case there are more lockdowns.</p>
<p>So, ask potential partners how they&rsquo;re meeting the new work-from-home challenges. How much was service disrupted when their area was first locked down, and how long did it take to reach pre-pandemic service levels, if they reached those levels at all?</p>
<p>Furthermore, how have they adapted to the technical challenges of working from home? For example, you might ask what the average internet speed is for those working from home, or if they have minimum requirements for internet speeds to ensure their staff are able to keep up with demands.</p>
<p>There are other considerations about outsourcing from home too, such as how they&rsquo;re dealing with background noise. It may not sound (mind the pun) like a big deal, but if a call is really noisy, the customer&rsquo;s experience suffers quite a lot. At Peak Support, we use software called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp.ai</a> to minimize the impact of background noise like barking dogs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ask how they&rsquo;re handling data security with people working from home. Are agents working from home allowed to use their own personal computers, and if so, how is security managed on those devices? How does the outsource customer service company ensure that agents&rsquo; WiFi is password protected?</p>
<h2>What locations do they offer and what has life been like in those places over the last 6 months?</h2>
<p>The reality of having lots of locations means there will be differences with how things are going locally at each office. Essentially, how well are different countries an outsourcer is operating in handling the virus? Have there been lots of outbreaks, or multiple rounds of lockdowns?</p>
<p>Some international locations have had more of an issue handling the pandemic, which could have a direct impact on their ability to keep up with client demands. Knowing whether or not customer service agents have returned to the office, if they&rsquo;re still working from home, or a combination of the two, are needed details.</p>
<p>For example, those in the rural US oftentimes don&rsquo;t have access to high-speed internet. For agents only handling email tickets, that&rsquo;s probably not an issue. However, if they&rsquo;re using a VOIP to take calls, that could be problematic, as it requires more bandwidth.</p>
<p>Really, it comes down to figuring out if their staff is able to handle what you need them to.</p>
<h2>How are they recruiting, onboarding, and training new team members?</h2>
<p>Everyone, agents and employers, is adjusting to the new work-from-home climate. For some, it&rsquo;s not been as jarring a switch. Perhaps they already employed some remote customer service agents, so they had measures already in place. However, for those operating in call centers, or something similar, it may have been a very large shift.</p>
<p>With that being the case, it&rsquo;s critical to understand how they&rsquo;re recruiting new talent. At Peak Support, we&#8217;re 100% remote and have been since day one, so we&#8217;re constantly getting a steady stream of candidates who want to work from home. Are other outsource customer service companies able to do that? How do they interview? How has their interview process changed?</p>
<p>Another new reality is training the staff that they successfully recruit. For large call centers, classroom training has been relatively common, but isn&rsquo;t an option in many places currently. Ask how they&rsquo;re handling the new reality and try to get a pulse check on how it&rsquo;s gone so far.</p>
<h2>What is their business continuity plan &#8211; and how well did it work?</h2>
<p>A business continuity plan is a roadmap a company uses to get back on track after going through some sort of crisis. As we&rsquo;ve been made well aware of this year, things can change very quickly and it&rsquo;s incredibly important to have measures in place to handle issues when they arise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a near certainty that any customer service outsourcing company you may be hiring needed to use some sort of business continuity plan over the last six months. Since we&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet, it&rsquo;s pertinent that you ask how their plan worked, how they communicated to clients, and how they&rsquo;ve adjusted their business continuity plan for any new issues that may arise. Not only will this show how prepared they are, but it will also indicate how quickly they can adapt to changes.</p>
<p>To get a more unfiltered view, ask for customer references and talk to at least two. Customers have less incentive to put a positive spin on things and you might get a better read on the situation that way.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The world is a little weird right now. As we try to get things back to some version of normal, we need to be cognizant that certain things have changed. Things that worked in a pre-pandemic world may no longer hold up.</p>
<p>For those looking to bring on an outsourcer to help outsource customer service, it&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re taking the new climate into consideration during the vetting process. Be sure to ask how things went, and get insight on how they plan to make sure things go smoothly moving forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Covid-19 pandemic pushes the limits of our global economy and healthcare systems, another, quieter crisis underpins it all&mdash;the toll it&rsquo;s taking on our mental health.</p>
<p>The pandemic has already had a negative impact on our mental well-being. We&rsquo;re physically distancing from loved ones and our normal way of life, and anxious about a still-mysterious and deadly illness.</p>
<ul>
<li>In May, a report by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/mental-health-fallout">Ipsos</a> found that one quarter of Singaporeans said they were not in good mental health, while a more recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.buro247.sg/lifestyle/insiders/effects-of-circuit-breaker-on-singaporeans-sleep-deprivation-mental-health-awareness-increased-financial-stress-and-more.html">report</a> by PURE Group found that almost half of surveyed Singaporeans (49%) were affected by work-related stress during Circuit Breaker&mdash;Singapore&rsquo;s &ldquo;lockdown&rdquo;&mdash;than anything else</li>
<li>Additionally, 19% of Singaporeans said they suffered from mental health-related issues during this time, with a lack of sleep, financial problems, and work pressures being the biggest causes</li>
</ul>
<p>The mental-health fallout of COVID-19 in the workforce is alarming and needs more attention. According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mmc.com/insights/publications/2020/march/2020-global-talent-trends-study.html">Mercer&rsquo;s 2020 Global Talent Trends Study</a>, while 45% of executives believe their talent can adapt to this &lsquo;new world of work&rsquo;, just 14% actually conducted internal surveys to discover how employees are coping. Even before COVID-19, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.asean.mercer.com/newsroom/covid-19-crisis-is-turning-point-for-employee-mental-health-in-asia-id.html">World Health Organization</a> said around 86 million people in Southeast Asia alone live with depression, and 60 million with anxiety.</p>
<p>So, while companies usually talk about disruption in terms of what it means for business models, I believe that the most disruptive businesses in 2021 and beyond will be the ones that truly focus on how they approach and manage the mental well-being of their people.</p>
<h2>Every company must make mental wellbeing a business priority</h2>
<p>With mental illnesses rising in every country in the world, dealing with mental health at an organizational level is imperative.</p>
<p>After all, how many employees would truly feel comfortable asking for a &lsquo;mental health day&rsquo;, or even taking an allocated sick day to focus on their mental well-being? There is still a stigma attached to mental health, where employees may fear being ostracized, demoted, or even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/open-mental-health-issues-work-puts-workers-risk-dismissal/">dismissed</a> for simply disclosing their need for mental-wellness support.</p>
<p>While many companies around the world have increased their focus on workplace mental health, it&rsquo;s often done in a reactive manner <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://time.com/collection/davos-2020-mental-health/5764680/mental-health-at-work/">when prompted by employees</a>. But a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-SG/Insights/2019/11/2020-global-medical-trends-survey-report">Willis Towers Watson 2020 Global Medical Trends Survey</a> found insurance providers across APAC predicted mental health and behavioural conditions will be among the top three most common conditions over the next five years. This is not a small number&mdash;but it&rsquo;s something we can prepare for as employers.</p>
<p>Organizations with a strong focus on overall health are likely to be better equipped in the current pandemic, and it&rsquo;s never too late to change the way you support your workforce:</p>
<h3>Make sure employees are aware of internal resources available to them</h3>
<p>You might have all the resources at your disposal, but if employees don&rsquo;t feel comfortable accessing and using them, then what&rsquo;s the point? In my experience, employees that are aware of and encouraged to use internal resources are better at identifying and managing their stressors, and therefore become better at looking after their own mental wellbeing.</p>
<h3>Be a vulnerable leader</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport">One study</a> found Millennials and Gen Z want mental health to become a normalized part of the employment experience&mdash;probably because 60% had never spoken about their mental health struggles with anyone at work, and one third had even left a previous job due to mental-health pressures.</p>
<p>While sharing your own mental-health struggles can be truly powerful&mdash;as a leader or otherwise&mdash;it&rsquo;s easier said than done. To create change, we can start small, such as letting someone know the reason you&rsquo;re leaving early one day is to have a couple of hours to yourself, or to attend a therapy appointment. Being a vulnerable leader will open the door for others to share, too.</p>
<h3>Be flexible and inclusive in your approach to mental wellness</h3>
<p>This means not assuming what employees need, but rather taking a customized approach. Mental well-being is most certainly has a diversity and inclusion element, as different demographic groups will have different needs for support. The experience of mental health is in no way uniform, and our approach shouldn&rsquo;t be either.</p>
<h2>Lead by example with your own self-care</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why, on airplanes, they tell you to look after yourself before tending to others.</p>
<p>I recently started a new role in a new company, and with that comes meeting new people, of course. This is something that can create anxiety for me at the best of times, but it was amplified by being forced to do it virtually in the midst of a pandemic.</p>
<p>I realised that I had to check in with myself more often and manage my own wellbeing, enabling me to listen better to others and understand what they were finding difficult as I transitioned into my new role.</p>
<p>Putting your own oxygen mask on first can look like many different things, but in my experience,these are the best tips for self-care as a leader:</p>
<h3>Check in with yourself</h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t identify the areas of your life that need more attention before you check the pulse of your mental health. Ask yourself how you&rsquo;re <em>really</em> doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling more stressed than usual, crying more often, struggling to sleep, or failing to find joy in things that once excited you, it&rsquo;s probably time to exercise some proper self-care.</p>
<h3>Plan your treatment</h3>
<p>For me, building resilience in chaotic timescalls for routine. I take an early morning walk each day; getting out in nature helps me get ready for my busy day ahead. I have also taken up Yin Yoga, which is a great way to end my day and wind down after all those Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Anything that is regular, expected, and formulaic will help when you&rsquo;re surrounded by other factors you can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<h3>Ask for help, and be available to help others</h3>
<p>Shaking up your self-care can&rsquo;t always be done alone. We all need assistance from the people around us, either to hold us accountable, to give advice, or simply to listen to us.</p>
<p>But there are times when we need more help than our loved ones can provide, and reaching out to professional resources is always a good idea. In conjunction with this, you can also make sure you&rsquo;re available for others, and reach out to show people how much you appreciate them.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go on this COVID-19 journey, and as much as we would like things to return to the way they were, they won&rsquo;t anytime soon. We can&rsquo;t control everything, but we can control how we respond to our new reality, looking after ourselves and others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&rsquo;t bother choosing between speed and quality when it comes to customer experience, because businesses need both to be among the best.</p>
<p>Speed plus effectiveness is the formula for CX success, according to findings by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) Research. Leading CX orgs are <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-centric-business/">customer-centric</a> to the hilt; they resolve customer issues more quickly, all while handling more customer requests overall and engaging with those customers on more channels.</p>
<p>Another way to describe speed plus effectiveness is <strong>agility</strong>. And leading CX orgs have it in spades.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>Champions are 6.1x more likely than Starters to be extremely agile when it comes to responding to customer needs.</p>
</div>
<h2>Champions excel at customer-centric agility</h2>
<p>The ESG findings, outlined in <em>CX Champions: How CX Leaders Who Raise Their Game Are Driving Business Success</em>, puts a framework around CX maturity. By surveying 1,000 CX leaders around the globe, ESG identified three levels of maturity: the Champions, the Risers, and the Starters&mdash;the leaders, those somewhere in the middle, and those at the greatest risk of falling behind.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;Our customers&rsquo; time is valuable, and wasting it is a CX capital offense.&rdquo;<br />
  <cite>2020 <em>CX Champions</em> report, ESG Research</cite>
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>These <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/cx-maturity-best-practices/">CX maturity best practices</a> allow companies to compare, contrast, and improve their CX operations by identifying their current states and where they can grow. And the stakes are high, as the report plainly puts it:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig deeper into what Champions did to hone that agility, exploring how they use technology to create <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-effort/">low-effort customer experiences</a>&mdash;one of the key hallmarks of excellent CX.</p>
<h2>Using tech to create low-effort experiences for customers and support agents</h2>
<p>ESG describes deploying best-of-breed technologies for support staff as &ldquo;a means to many ends,&rdquo; seeing as how Champions will invest in technology that will make their teams successful.</p>
<p>Not only do they use technologies that are highly rated by their support teams and leaders, 57% of Champions expect their organization to increase investment significantly in the next 12 months, compared to just 9% of Starters. This suggests that CX technology is a continued, scalable investment&mdash;far from a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; scenario.</p>
<p>A stellar tech stack has a lot to do with Champions&rsquo; enviable successes, but only when it is deployed in a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-centric-business/">customer-centric</a> way. There are a few ways Champions use technology to drive success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology engages customers wherever they are</li>
<li>Technology supports people and processes on the CX front lines</li>
<li>Technology doesn&rsquo;t even feel like a technology solution to customers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology engages customers wherever they are</h2>
<p>On average,<strong> Champions offer two more channels</strong> of customer engagement than Starters. We know that customers want to engage with companies on their preferred channels, at their own pace, and the ESG findings further support that. Offering multiple channels for engagement is one way to provide the low-effort experiences customers are looking for.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Champions are embracing the full omnichannel experience. Though almost everyone provided phone and email support, Champions were much more likely to also include an online help center, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/state-of-messaging-2020/">messaging apps</a>, social media support, live chat support, and SMS among their offerings.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>Messaging apps and online help centers are the third and fourth most-used support channels after phone and email. They are especially popular among Champions, being used for customer service among 89% and 92% of them, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p>Online help centers and external knowledge bases can impact CX because if customers can search for an answer to a problem and troubleshoot themselves, they much prefer to do so. The impact of ticket deflection&mdash;tickets that never were&mdash;can, in turn, impact a support team.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s examine how technology is used at Champion-level companies to support front-line people and processes.</p>
<h2>Technology supports people and processes on the CX front lines</h2>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>Champions are 3.5x more likely than Beginners to be top performers in terms of agent efficiency.</p>
</div>
<p>The act of supporting agents does not mean turning them into ticket-processing machines or multiple-chat-window wizards. Providing agents with up-to-date technology is also necessary to decrease the chances of burnout, according to the findings.</p>
<p>When agents have a complete view of the customer&mdash;via a customer profile with their support and purchase history&mdash;and when they can toggle between channels when engaging with customers, it improves their experience. Few things are more frustrating than technology that lets you down time and time again, and the findings indicate that Champions saw this coming and invested wisely in their tech stack.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>When asked to rate their support staff satisfaction with the technology and tools to perform their jobs, <strong>93% of Champions</strong> rated their teams&rsquo; satisfaction as either a 9 or 10&mdash;the best on the scale.</p>
</div>
<h2>Technology doesn&rsquo;t even feel like a technology solution to customers</h2>
<p>We know that low-effort customer experiences are a hallmark of great CX, and technology plays a huge role in simplifying those experiences. But technology can also complicate matters when it&rsquo;s not integrated thoughtfully with solutions already in place.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;If our customer must be transferred to multiple departments to find their answer, repeatedly reach out to obtain the right response, or use multiple channels to receive an appropriate solution&mdash;we are making them work far too hard.&rdquo;<br />
  <cite>2020 <em>CX Champions</em> report, ESG Research</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/chatbots-for-business/">chatbots</a>, which the report found was making an impact with other AI tools in streamlining operations. When deployed poorly&mdash;by providing nonsense or irrelevant answers or placed at odd places in the experience&mdash;they&rsquo;re a nightmare. When deployed smartly, they successfully solve an estimated <strong>8% of customer queries</strong> and thereby offload repetitive (boring) work off agents&rsquo; plates.</p>
<p>The lesson is to not add solutions for the sake of what&rsquo;s new and shiny, but to do so because it, as mentioned, supports the people and the processes on the front lines.</p>
<p>As one retail leader describes it, the <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/simple-sophisticated-mullet-imperative-seamless-cx/">best CX is a simple, customer-facing front end</a> supported by a sophisticated back end that provides a business with the information it needs to keep improving and innovating that experience.</p>
<h2>Champions meet&mdash;or exceed&mdash;customer expectations</h2>
<p>The writing is on the wall, and it appears that everyone can see it. When asked to agree or disagree if their organization will lose business to more customer-centric competitors if CX is not continually improved, <strong>89% of all respondents said yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Using CX technology in smart ways while keeping focus on customers and their experience is a tried-and-true way to maintain and even grow a customer base. Keeping customer-centricity, especially in periods rife with change, can be a challenge. But take it from <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/change-leader-customer-centricity/">Zendesk CIO Colleen Berube</a>, who explains how successful companies lean on technology to improve their CX:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are defining industries rather than building on the status quo. This allows them to be nimble and use technology as a tool that helps them meet business objectives, as opposed to a system that drives how they run their business.&rdquo;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A company&rsquo;s customer experience (CX) operation can mature just like people, careers, and bottles of wine, but only if it gets the high level of investment and prioritization necessary to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The road to CX maturity means taking a few wrong turns, acknowledging mistakes, and putting lessons into practice until they become process. Leaders might have rough ideas about where they stand on this front, and many might say they know with certainty.</p>
<p>To help leaders understand, objectively, where they stand, Zendesk partnered with ESG Research to build a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/cx-champion-maturity-report/">framework around CX maturity</a> and CX success.</p>
<p>By surveying 1,000 CX leaders around the globe, ESG identified three levels of maturity: the leaders, those in the middle of the pack, and those at risk of falling behind&mdash;the <strong>Champions</strong>, the <strong>Risers</strong>, and the <strong>Starters</strong>. Their insights helped identify the keys to achieving CX maturity and, as a result, exceeding business outcomes and achieving long-term success.</p>
<p>Regardless of where they stand on the spectrum or the industry they represent, the vast majority&mdash;89%&mdash;of those surveyed agree that CX stagnation will lead to business disruption. Still, identifying where to invest time and resources can be a major challenge. Let&rsquo;s break it down.</p>
<h2>Key indicators of CX maturity</h2>
<p>There are a few qualities that CX Champions had in common that separate them from the pack, according to the ESG findings.</p>
<p>More mature organizations enjoy improved service and support KPIs, greater qualitative optimism, and better overall business outcomes. They respond faster to customer queries, they are better able to solve customer issues once they respond, and the overall experience requires low levels of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-effort/">customer effort</a>&mdash;and we know that the harder you make customers work, the more likely they are to churn.</p>
<p>Leadership and the organization as a whole also elevates and recognizes support teams as key partners in the effort. As a result of all of this, these companies are better positioned to adapt to volatile or uncertain work environments, and they have enviable confidence in their ability to weather those conditions in the long term.</p>
<p>According to ESG&#8217;s findings, Champions are excelling in seven key ways.</p>
<h2>Where Champions excel</h2>
<ol>
<li>Skilling up the service team</li>
<li>Maintaining appropriate staffing levels</li>
<li>Ability to act on customer feedback</li>
<li>Agility in acting on customer feedback</li>
<li>Strong data/visualization into service and support performance</li>
<li>Timeliness of service and support performance data</li>
<li>Quality of the technology experience delivered to service and support personnel</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of their investment in these seven things, companies considered CX champions deliver on their promises by:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Meeting customer expectations</li>
<li>Setting agents up for success</li>
<li>Running agile business operations</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig deeper into all three, explaining how each shows up in businesses with Champion-level CX operations.</p>
<h2>Meeting customer expectations</h2>
<p><strong>Creating a fast and easy customer experience</strong> and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/meet-customers-anywhere-with-the-suite/"><strong>meeting customers where they are</strong></a> are two ways to meet customer expectations.</p>
<p>Champions have fast resolution times&mdash;they are more than <strong>twice as likely</strong> as Starters to report a total resolution time of under an hour. Furthermore, their average first response time was <strong>an hour faster</strong> than the Starters&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And&ndash;this is key&mdash;they view having a mature CX operation as a <strong>competitive differentiator</strong>. They are willing to make the investment and, as a result, are also confident in their ability to retain customers, according to the findings. Starters, on the other hand, can take upward of seven hours to resolve an issue and aren&rsquo;t as confident in their ability to retain customers.</p>
<p>As discussed above, <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/d2c-retail-simple-customer-experience-just-need-right-now/">low-effort customer experiences</a> are, well, easier, and therefore earn a business more brownie points. A low-effort customer experience means that the customer didn&rsquo;t have to guess too hard about what happens next, nor did they have to look too hard to find the support they needed. In other words, the touchpoints in the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/fantastic-voyage-customer-journey-mapping-well-worth-effort/">customer journey</a> all made sense and were appropriate for whatever the customer wanted at that time: maybe it was a series of knowledge base articles to conduct more research, a community forum to ask questions, or the ability to quickly escalate from self-service to agent-assisted support.</p>
<p>Meeting customers where they are goes hand-in-hand with a low-effort experience, because if customers have to work too hard to get help or ask questions about the product, the company is more likely to lose their business.</p>
<h2>Setting agents up for success</h2>
<p>Support agents are on the front lines of the CX operation, often the first point of human contact someone has with the business. Given their high visibility, the ESG data finds that companies with the most mature CX operations also set their agents up for success in a number of ways.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/the-impact-of-customer-service/">empowered support team</a> has a huge impact on both the maturity and success of a CX operation.</p>
<p>Building efficiency into the customer support process makes the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/agent-experience-guide/">agent experience</a> better. That means giving agents the tools, including training opportunities and technology, to excel at their jobs. When <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-vs-customer-service/">customer support agents</a> are viewed as strategic partners instead of one-off troubleshooters, it helps the individual agents, it helps customers, and it helps the business. And, it shows: Champion organizations struggle less with agent retention, <em>and</em> their agents are more efficient, according to the data.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h4>Agents at Champion organizations handle nearly double the requests of Starters.</h4>
</div>
<p>Champions reduce average total resolution time by 34%, or nearly three hours, compared to Starters, and they&rsquo;re a staggering six times more likely than starters to exceed formal CSAT goals. In other words, support agents at Champion companies are nailing it in terms of efficiency, which is a direct result of their efforts in these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing more education and training</li>
<li>Investing in technology that allows agents to meet customers where they are</li>
<li>Regularly digging into data and acting on what it&rsquo;s saying</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running agile business operations</h2>
<p>Champions also lead on what ESG describes as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/how-to-be-customer-centric/">customer-centric agility</a>.&rdquo; In other words, these companies put customers first when making their business decisions&mdash;about support, staffing, perhaps even about the products themselves. They listen to what customers are telling them, and they adjust operations accordingly to meet those needs.</p>
<p>Take meal-delivery service <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-centric-self-service-tips-freshly/">Freshly</a>, for example, which revamped its entire self-service support experience by crafting high-quality content and making it easy to find. The moral of the story: the solution wasn&rsquo;t merely creating a new channel (self-service), deploying it, crossing fingers, and hoping for the best. It required additional investment: making the content relevant, searchable, and easy to use for their unique customer base.</p>
<p>There is no agility or adaptability without <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-experience-support-data/">data analysis</a>. A lot of businesses truly don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know, and ESG findings indicate that it is hurting them. While many Starter companies report infrequently reviewing CX metrics, nearly half of the Champions review metrics daily.</p>
<h2>All in on CX</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about the three keys to achieving CX maturity: Businesses can&rsquo;t choose just one of the three, focusing in one area and putting the others off until later. Focusing on all three and ensuring they form a true CX infrastructure is essential&mdash;and it&rsquo;s actually quite difficult to be good at one without investing in the others.</p>
<p>ESG data indicates that organizations were more focused on adding value than reducing cost, which is easier said than done for smaller operations, in a lean year, or maybe a little bit of both. But CX is a long game that requires a long-term, all-in approach that is known to pay off. Take it from the Champions&mdash;78% of which were confident in their company&rsquo;s future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pressure is on for companies to continuously optimize their customer experience (CX). Small businesses with fewer resources are no exception, but it can be difficult to know where to make those strategic investments.</p>
<p>To help CX leaders at SMBs identify where they stand and build a roadmap for the future, Zendesk partnered with ESG Research to build a framework around CX maturity and CX success. The findings are summarized in this report: <em>CX Champions: How CX Leaders Who Raise Their Game Are Driving Business Success</em>.</p>
<p>After surveying more than 500 CX leaders at small businesses all over the world—those with fewer than 100 employees—ESG identified three levels of maturity: leaders, those in the middle, and those at risk of falling behind. In the report, they&#8217;re called Champions, Risers, and Starters. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago, the general consensus was that you didn’t bring your personal politics into the workplace. Employees endeavored to avoid discussions about politics (other than of the office variety) around the water cooler, and employers took pains to keep potentially divisive political conversations out of the conference room.</p>
<p>As we approach the end of a tumultuous year, this once-universal norm feels like one more quaint feature of a bygone era. With the U.S. deeply divided on a range of social issues from the science around Covid-19 to climate change to abortion, this fall’s election will likely be the most important of our lifetime. And with that, conversations about the upcoming election are not only happening nonstop across the media and our social feeds, they’re happening via Zoom and over Slack, too—in other words, at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the U.S. deeply divided on a range of social issues from the science around Covid-19 to climate change to abortion, this fall&#8217;s election will likely be the most important of our lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of what’s at stake this November, formerly niche discussions have moved into the mainstream as new cohorts engage in political speak. Generation Z has mobilized, using all the social media tools at its disposal; there is a heightened awareness of the historic disenfranchisement of voters of color; voter suppression is now widely discussed; and, an increasing number of influential athletes and celebrities have chosen to use their platform to encourage all Americans to vote.</p>
<p>In the midst of this movement, U.S. companies are also stepping up—and speaking out—in unprecedented ways.</p>
<h4>Times are changing—and so are we</h4>
<p>To many observers, companies taking a stand around the election is the logical next step in a pattern that’s been trending for a while. After all, we’ve gotten used to powerful corporations, armed with money and empowered by global platforms, expressing opinions and influencing policy. And, <a href="https://www.conecomm.com/news-blog/2016-cone-communications-millennial-employee-engagement-study-press-release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studies</a> show we expect it. To maintain the loyalty of socially-conscious customers, particularly powerful Millennials, many companies are deciding to take a stand. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/why-and-how-companies-invest-in-get-out-the-vote-efforts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> in the Harvard Business Review, the trend toward corporate participation in our electoral process has been building, driven in large part by the increasing polarization of our country and the knowledge that election outcomes have hinged in recent years on just tens of thousands of votes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain the loyalty of socially-conscious customers, particularly powerful Millennials, many companies are deciding to take a stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In 2018, voter turnout in the U.S. midterm elections was the highest of any midterm election in the last century. Of the many factors contributing to this achievement, hundreds of companies encouraged their employees and/or consumers to vote. For these companies, ‘get out the vote’ programs not only helped get more voters to the polls but also helped to raise brand awareness, strengthen relationships between employees and shareholders, and even open dialogue with elected officials.”</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter protests, ignited by the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others, compelled companies to come out with strong statements of solidarity and action—publicly—that support racial justice, forging new partnerships, and that include donating vast sums of money and openly messaging their actions along the way. This year’s election, with its fraught voting process, offers another opportunity for organizations to express their corporate values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year&#8217;s election, with its fraught voting process, offers another opportunity for organizations to express their corporate values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This summer, we saw companies big and small use their platforms to state, ‘Black Lives Matter.’ It’s important to the ACLU that we help companies connect the dots on how they can operationalize those stated values. One way is by supporting voting rights initiatives like the Voting Rights Advancement Act,” said Danielle Silber, director of strategic partnerships at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The Voting Rights Act was rooted in the premise that all Americans have the right to vote, regardless of race or language proficiency. It was critical to the civil rights movement, ensuring hateful policies like poll taxes and literacy tests became historical footnotes. The VRAA would help prevent and end similar modern forms of vote suppression.</p>

<h4>Encouraging action above outcomes</h4>
<p>Against this backdrop, it’s not at all surprising that we’re now witnessing U.S. companies communicating pro-democracy values around the upcoming election. Companies are willing to get political (not to be confused with “partisan”) because they realize that the strength of the communities they operate in—as well as the wellbeing of their employees and their customers—hinge on a strong and participatory democracy.</p>
<p>The Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/why-and-how-companies-invest-in-get-out-the-vote-efforts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looked at</a> where companies are netting out on this trend, noting, “Studies show that consumers are <a href="https://www.edelman.com/earned-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more loyal to brands</a> that take a clear stance on issues they care about. But taking a partisan approach to civic engagement <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/06/03/why-we-dont-see-more-ceos-endorse-presidential-candidates/?utm_term=.57f3611dde4f" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can alienate employees or customers</a> in today’s hyperpartisan environment. Our study finds a sweet spot for firms: being pro-democracy and pro-voter, without being partisan.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Studies show that consumers are more loyal to brands that take a clear stance on issues they care about.&#8221; — Harvard Business Review</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some companies, being ”pro-voter” means not only encouraging employees to register and to vote, but also to join the broader “get out the vote” movement. Faced with the prospect of a shortage of poll workers this fall, businesses have devised specific policies—or been more vocal about existing ones—to encourage employees to volunteer during the election. </p>
<h4>Private sector partnerships</h4>
<p>It’s a rather dramatic development if you think about it, painting the private sector as more competent and influential than our government when it comes to elections. As <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/9/10/21428934/companies-pay-employees-poll-workers-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported by</a> Vox, “The responsibility of poll worker recruitment should theoretically fall on local and state policymakers, but currently, corporations are jumping in to fill this gap and partnering with bipartisan voter organizations, like Civic Alliance and Power to the Polls, to address the shortage.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/6-companies-tackling-social-justice-inspiring-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6 companies tackling social justice and inspiring customers</a>]</em></p>
<p>And companies are going beyond simply informing and mobilizing their workforces. In an attempt to address the tragic reality of our country’s chronic civic disengagement, nonprofit organizations like the ACLU are working closely with U.S. companies this year to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create a more informed electorate.</a> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>“We are working with companies to help educate their audiences about the long-term importance of civic literacy and voting rights and how enhanced civic engagement can impact the civil rights and civil liberties causes that companies and their audiences care about. Companies can help to educate employees, and sometimes customers, about the importance of down ballot races and ballot propositions on issues like racial justice, criminal justice reform, immigrants’ rights, LGBTQ rights, and women’s rights,” said Silber.</p>
<p>Hamstrung by a polarized, paralyzed government our democracy finds itself turning to corporate America for help. Thankfully, many companies are heeding the call.</p>
<p>As Silber explains, “It’s not enough to share information to help equip people with what they need to vote. We need the private sector to help to remove the barriers that prevent eligible voters from casting their ballot in the first place.”</p>

<h4>What voters need to know: Tips from the ACLU</h4>
<ul>
<li>Take the time to research your full ballot—every elected position matters for the issues you care about.</li>
<li>Consider volunteering as a poll worker (<a href="https://www.powerthepolls.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Power the Polls</a>) or with the ACLU (<a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/8yoVCpY99JfzApqDyUJggUr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">peoplepower.org</a>) to help ensure people have the information they need to vote.</li>
<li>Communicate to your elected officials the importance of election integrity and that you want them to support the Vote Safe Act and the USPS.</li>
<li><a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/VsuJCqxAAKCOXJnWRirt09e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Know your rights as a voter.</a></li>
<li>If you’re waiting in a long line on election day, stay in line, even if it’s getting close to poll closing time. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">If you’re in line when the polls close, your vote must be counted.</a></li>
<li>We may not know the election results on election night or the morning after. It takes time for mail-in ballots to be counted, and it’s important that we count every vote.</li>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about having the right opportunities,&rdquo; author and sales professional <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markhunter">Mark Hunter</a> asserts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about handling the opportunities right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, the quality of your leads matters, but understanding how to sell to those leads matters more. Sales reps need to know how to efficiently move leads from potential customers to converted, bonafide customers. They need sales training that teaches them how to do exactly that for your product and market.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where your team&rsquo;s chosen sales methodology comes into play. Choose a road map that reps can consistently follow to close more deals and bring in more revenue.</p>
<p>To choose the right sales strategy, you need to know your options and understand which are designed for companies like yours. We outline six of the most popular sales methodologies below, along with details on who they work well for.</p>

<h2 id="spin">SPIN sales methodology</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>SPIN selling is designed to help sales reps close difficult, complicated deals via relationship-building.</p>
<p>Neil Rackham introduced the methodology in his 1988 book, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070511136"><em>SPIN Selling</em></a>. Rackham outlines a framework for developing the right questions for customer-centric selling. The method also teaches reps when to ask the questions.</p>
<p>These questions fit into one of the four categories included in the SPIN acronym: <strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>P</strong>roblem questions, <strong>I</strong>mplication, and <strong>N</strong>eed-Payoff. They&rsquo;re designed to help sales reps close deals in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing the buyer&rsquo;s current situation</li>
<li>Identifying problems the buyer faces that your product can solve</li>
<li>Exploring the implications (causes and effects) of each problem</li>
<li>Showing why leads need your product&mdash;why it&rsquo;s worth buying</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use SPIN selling if:</h3>
<h5>Your goal is to build trust that leads to future investment</h5>
<p>SPIN&rsquo;s emphasis on relationship-building is unique among the most popular sales methodologies. It allows sales reps the time to get to know customers and listen to their customer&#8217;s needs. This approach may seem time-consuming, but its results are often long-lasting.</p>
<p>When done effectively, SPIN selling makes the customer feel like you&rsquo;re there to help them&mdash;regardless of whether they actually buy.</p>
<p>That gives reps an opportunity to work with customers where there&rsquo;s less pressure to buy. Removing some of the pressure to buy creates space for reps to develop a deeper sense of trust with prospects. Customer trust makes it easier for reps to sell products and services that are truly a good fit&mdash;in both the short term and the long term.</p>
<p>For companies just starting out, the SPIN methodology is a great way to build trust in the market. Plus, investing in long-term relationships can help differentiate you from a wide competitor pool and support your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/positioning-statement-examples/">brand positioning</a>.</p>

<h2 id="snap">SNAP sales methodology</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Created by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jillkonrath.com/snap-selling">Jill Konrath</a> in 2012, SNAP Selling is a methodology that helps reps sell to clients who are stressed out and in a hurry. It focuses on streamlining the sales cycle as much as possible. In other words, it&rsquo;s designed for the modern buyer.</p>
<p>SNAP stands for keep it <strong>S</strong>imple, be i<strong>N</strong>valuable, always <strong>A</strong>lign, raise <strong>P</strong>riorities. Each aspect is designed to speak to the types of questions frazzled, rushed customers have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>How simple is this solution? How much time and effort will it take to implement?</li>
<li>What does the cost/benefit of this solution look like?</li>
<li>Does this sales rep (and their pitch) align with our needs and goals?</li>
<li>Is this solution (and its implementation) a priority, or it can wait?</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind SNAP selling is to distill the selling process down to the core components. SNAP sellers leave aside fluff and relationship-building. Instead, they favor clear, simple communication and an expedited sales process.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use SNAP selling if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re an industry leader with name recognition</h5>
<p>If your company enjoys broad name recognition in your industry, SNAP selling can help you eliminate wasted time. It essentially enables reps to move past the first few steps of the buyer&#8217;s journey&mdash;heading directly to quoting and dealmaking. You already have the buyer&rsquo;s ear by virtue of your brand. Don&rsquo;t waste more of their limited time piling it on to earn their trust or authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Your target market works in fast-paced environments</h5>
<p>People who work in hectic environments are used to making decisions under pressure. They&rsquo;re looking for speed and efficiency in the buying process.</p>
<p>SNAP selling helps you outline the sales process in simple terms, making it faster to work through. Clearly state your product&#8217;s value and alignment with the buyer&#8217;s priorities. From there, it&#8217;s easy for them to make a quick decision about whether they want to move forward.</p>

<h2 id="challenger">Challenger sales methodology</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/power-challenger-sales-model/">Challenger</a> sales methodology is based on a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1591844355/">2011 book</a> by the same name written by Brent Adamson and Matthew Dixon. In the book, Adamson and Dixon say there are five B2B selling personas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationship builders</li>
<li>Hard workers</li>
<li>Lone wolves</li>
<li>Reactive problem-solvers</li>
<li>Challengers</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the book&rsquo;s authors, &ldquo;challengers&rdquo; represent 40% of top-performing sales reps. The Challenger Sale methodology seeks to help all reps sell more like those stellar reps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Challengers&rdquo; follow a three-step process: teach, tailor, take control. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309666/the-challenger-sale-by-matthew-dixon/9781591844358">The Challenger Sale</a> argues that these are the most important steps in the sales process. Reps teach the buyer about the industry as a whole, personalize their product, and then solve the problem.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use the Challenger sales methodology if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>Your product is on the complex side</h5>
<p>The first step in this technique is to consult your client about the industry as a whole. Your sales rep will help the customer critically assess the market and the products available. Reps provide all the necessary information up front. That brings clients to a place where they&#8217;re better equipped to understand your product and how it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>You have a large sales department</h5>
<p>One of the common pitfalls of large sales departments is the inability to personalize their sales pitch. The second step of this method is all about tailoring the pitch, pushing reps to mold their pitch to the customer&rsquo;s specific needs. Across a large sales department, adding this step helps ensure a personalized customer experience. This happens without having to forgo a structured team approach.</p>

<h2 id="sandler">Sandler sales methodology</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/sandler-sales-methodology">Sandler sales methodology</a> relies on a set of 49 rules that dictate how sellers and customers should be invested in the outcome of the sale. Ideally, customers view the sales rep as more of a trusted adviser than a traditional seller.</p>
<p>One of the cornerstones of this method is using questioning to guide customers to their own conclusions and solutions.</p>
<p>Sandler-trained reps also aim to find most objections during the beginning qualification process. If the rep discovers their product won&rsquo;t address the potential client&#8217;s concerns, they walk away. They won&rsquo;t waste time trying to convince the lead that their product will meet their goals.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use the Sandler sales methodology if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>Your business relies on frequent deals</h5>
<p>By analyzing the client&rsquo;s goals alongside them, sales reps form a collaborative, long-term relationship. Reps can then leverage this relationship to encourage future repeat purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re comfortable walking away from poor-fit deals</h5>
<p>The Sandler sales methodology is unique because it requires a candid analysis of the client&rsquo;s needs. If the sales rep feels the client&rsquo;s goals don&rsquo;t align with their product, they end the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="meddpic">MEDDPIC sales methodology</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Big enterprise deals require a large investment of time and effort on the part of sales reps. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.troops.ai/blog/meddic-vs-meddpic-vs-meddpicc">MEDDPIC</a> is a qualification process that ensures each complex deal is worth that investment.</p>
<p>With the MEDDPIC methodology, sales reps answer these questions before moving forward.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>etrics: What does the organization need to succeed? How are they defining success?</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>conomic Buyer: Who is the person who holds decision-making power for new purchases?</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>ecision criteria: What technical, budgetary, or other requirements do you need to meet for the organization to consider you an option?</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>ecision process: What steps does the organization take to vet and decide on a purchase? What stakeholders are involved?</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>aper process: What contracts are required and what steps are needed to process and sign the order?</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>dentify pain: Why is the organization seeking a solution in the first place? What problem are you solving and what impact does it have on the organization?</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>hampion: Who is the person in the organization who needs your solution the most? Who will push to make the purchase happen?</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions up front, reps ensure that the potential deal justifies any time spent with a prospect.</p>
</p></div>

<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use the MEDDPIC sales methodology if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re selling large deals</h5>
<p>On its face, MEDDPIC is designed to produce fewer deals, so you can focus on the largest ones that are most likely to close. If your business relies on having a lot of customers, MEDDPIC may hamstring your sales team from bringing in leads. However, if your typical deal size is large, your reps need the bandwidth to close them. MEDDPIC affords them that time and space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re comfortable walking away from low-value leads</h5>
<p>According to MEDDPIC selling, the prospects you choose are more important than the rest of the sales process. That means reps need to be comfortable walking away from leads that aren&rsquo;t valuable enough to justify the time required to close them. If they don&rsquo;t meet the designated criteria (assessed using the MEDDPIC questions) for your sales organization, you don&rsquo;t move forward.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Also called the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.millerheimangroup.com/training/advanced-selling/conceptual-selling/"> Miller Heiman sales methodology</a>, the Conceptual Selling methodology urges salespeople not to lead with a pitch.

<p>The methodology was developed by Robert Miller and Stephen Heiman. The method is founded on the idea that customers don&rsquo;t buy a product or a service; customers buy their concept of the solution that offering represents.</p>
<p>The Conceptual Selling method places a heavy emphasis on listening. To that end, it suggests questions to help reps uncover the solution prospects need. The questions fall into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirmation questions</strong> reaffirm information you&rsquo;ve heard from the buyer.</li>
<li><strong>New information questions</strong> help reps to home in on the prospect&rsquo;s concept of your product and what the prospect wants to achieve through the product.</li>
<li><strong>Attitude questions</strong> look to understand a prospect and their motivations on a personal level, along with uncovering their personal connection to the project.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment questions</strong> help reps gain insight into a prospect&rsquo;s level of investment in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Basic issue questions</strong> raise potential problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rep uses these questions to understand the prospect&rsquo;s view of the problem and the solution. From there, they can tailor their pitch to mirror the desired solution.</p>
</p></div>

<h3>Use the Conceptual Selling sales methodology if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re selling complex deals that require many people to sign off</h5>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to generate agreement around a solution than a product. All decision-makers can get behind solving a problem within the business.</p>
<p>Objections tend to arise when you break it down to the details of a particular product. Concerns around small details can prevent reps from securing sign-off. And when you&rsquo;re dealing with many decision-makers, that process happens over and over. Instead, the Miller Heiman sales methodology enables reps to harness sign-off on the broader solution. Then, they work out the finer details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re comfortable taking a customer-centric selling approach</h5>
<p>Conceptual selling inherently requires sales reps to give up the driver&rsquo;s seat. Instead of leading with a pitch, reps spend much more time listening up front. They follow the potential customer&rsquo;s lead, tailoring their ultimate pitch to the customer&rsquo;s concept of your product. Sellers used to driving conversations and prescribing solutions may be less comfortable here.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-5">
<p>If you found yourself nodding along with more than one of the sales methodologies outlined above, you&rsquo;re not alone. In some cases, the right choice for your sales team or company may involve combining multiple sales methodologies.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to shoehorn an entire team into one sales method that doesn&rsquo;t always fit.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">

<div class="col col-small-6">
<h3>Use a mixture of sales methodologies if:</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h5>You have multiple buyer personas who respond best to different sales methodologies</h5>
<p>This can happen when you offer multiple product types or if you have a particular prospect that doesn&rsquo;t fit the usual mold. For example, your deals may require sign-off from end users and C-suite executives. In that case, you&rsquo;re better off using different methodologies to approach each type of decision-maker.</p>
<li>
<h5>You&rsquo;re unsure which methodology will work best for your team</h5>
<p>If you have gotten this far and still aren&rsquo;t sure which methodology will work best for your team, that&rsquo;s okay. Test multiple sales processes with different buyers. You can better measure and assess which works best for your sales team after you&rsquo;ve tried a few.</p>

<h2>Use data to verify the right sales methodology for your team</h2>

<p>Whenever you implement a new sales methodology (or a few of them), closely monitor how it affects sales performance. Measure how the new method impacts the number and rate of deals moving to closed-won.

<p>Stories of great customer experiences often go viral because they&rsquo;re exceptional outliers. An airline <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.today.com/style/southwest-airlines-rescues-forgotten-bridesmaid-dress-saves-day-t149743">saves the day</a> by flying out a bridesmaid dress, or a support rep <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.today.com/health/customer-service-rep-saves-man-having-stroke-phone-call-t161110">saves a life</a> by realizing the caller was having a stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tend to think of customer experience as these big old moonshots, and going above and beyond, and just knocking socks off,&rdquo; says <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachandler/">Samantha Chandler</a>, one of Zendesk&rsquo;s customer success team managers. &ldquo;But what customers really tend to want is consistency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Customers want your company&rsquo;s different departments working together to deliver that consistency. Over 70% of customers expect companies to collaborate on their behalf, and 68% get annoyed when their call is transferred between departments, according to Zendesk&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/">2020 Customer Experience Trends Report</a>.</p>
<p>Providing a smooth, consistent customer experience across an entire organization requires careful planning, close monitoring, and continual adjustments. We talked to Zendesk&rsquo;s experts for their thoughts on using customer experience management to deliver reliably great customer experience.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is customer experience management (and why does it matter)?</h2>
<p><strong>Customer experience management</strong>, or CXM, is a company&rsquo;s system for tracking, overseeing, and influencing all customer contact points.</p>
<p>The purpose of CXM is to provide a consistent level of customer service, improve brand loyalty, and deepen engagement.</p>
</p></div>
<p>All customer interactions fall under the purview of CXM&mdash;which can make it feel like a pretty big undertaking.</p>
<blockquote><p>
        &ldquo;Anything that the customer can interact with is part of the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-experience-guide/">customer experience</a>. You need to be managing that experience so that all of your teams are working together to provide a seamless, pleasant experience.&rdquo;<br />
        <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-dyson/">Dave Dyson</a>, Senior Customer Service Evangelist at Zendesk</cite>
      </p></blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to reliably deliver that sort of seamless service, it will fortify and eventually expand your customer base.</p>
<blockquote><p>
        &ldquo;A lot of emphasis is put on bringing in new customers, but you&rsquo;ve also got to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/improve-customer-loyalty-and-retention/">retain existing customers</a>&mdash;especially in SaaS, where a lot of businesses are focused on &lsquo;land and expand.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
        <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-reuter-0b02383a/">Brian Reuter</a>, Director of Customer Success at Zendesk</cite>
      </p></blockquote>
<p>Brian also points out that great customer experiences also benefit word of mouth and can attract additional new sales.</p>
<p>CXM is especially helpful for identifying and anticipating common customer complaints. The better you get at proactively addressing those issues, the lower your support costs become.</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t everyone reaping the benefits of customer experience management? In part, it&rsquo;s because companies of all shapes and sizes often struggle to get their arms around all of their contact points with customers. New startups are often disorganized, while large enterprises suffer from siloing different departments.</p>
<p>If your organization has faced CXM challenges, consider these expert tips for overcoming them.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Balance internal goals with customer-facing objectives</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Customer experience management pushes companies to evaluate their brand experience from the customer&rsquo;s point of view, not the company&rsquo;s. Without that angle, departments often set internal goals that conflict with the customer&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your departments often have metrics that they&rsquo;re trying to meet that are not customer-facing goals,&rdquo; Dave explains. &ldquo;Your support team might want to lower costs by 10%. And if you just focus on that, it can actually steer you into a worse customer experience at the same time that you&rsquo;re meeting those goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, trying to keep all customer conversations under five minutes will improve your call center&rsquo;s efficiency&mdash;but it will also likely translate to a terrible customer experience.</p>
<p>Before adopting any departmental or company-wide objective, it&rsquo;s important to ask, &ldquo;How will this affect the customer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting people within the company focused on improving the customer experience can be a hard sell,&rdquo; warns Dave. &ldquo;Especially if you have a siloed organization, or you don&rsquo;t have a Chief Customer Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he feels it&rsquo;s important to have leaders who are constantly beating the drum of &ldquo;make it about the customer.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Get executive buy-in for new initiatives</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re investing in <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-experience-management-software/">CXM software</a>, other parts of your tech stack, or even just a new customer-oriented strategy, it&rsquo;s crucial that you have leadership&rsquo;s backing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Executive sponsorship cannot be overstated when it comes to adoption and implementation,&rdquo; Sam says. &ldquo;In fact, only about a quarter of projects that don&rsquo;t have effective executive sponsorship actually make it off of the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To get executive buy-in, managers need to curate the most relevant data points. After all, executives often don&rsquo;t have time to look at a sea of numbers.</p>
<p>According to Brian, it helps if you&rsquo;re able to both show the ROI of your proposed customer experience initiative and tell a compelling customer story about why you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show the long-term impact,&rdquo; Brian advises. &ldquo;Not just that a customer was upset one time, but that the customer then tweeted about it and got other people upset, or later left us for the competition.&rdquo;</p>
</p></div>

<h2>Tip #3: Pull actionable CX insights from hard data</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>CXM strategies focus on both the experience of using your product or service and the experience of interacting with your business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re tracking product complaints, that can help steer you towards product improvements,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re tracking the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/fantastic-voyage-customer-journey-mapping-well-worth-effort/">customer journey</a> from start to end, looking at all the touchpoints where customers interact with you and where those break down, that&rsquo;s a good process, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both processes require an automated system for capturing relevant data sets. Customer experience management software solutions like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/#features">Zendesk Explore</a> provide instant access to all of the customer analytics your company needs to be measuring:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Filter customer conversation by reason for contact, whether that&rsquo;s product support, pricing concerns, or any other issue</li>
<li>Integrate engagement data from every communication channel so you know how customers prefer to interact with your brand</li>
<li>Identify problem areas from support tickets</li>
<li>Quickly fix routing issues to improve support operations</li>
<li>See which support teams and agents have high or low <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/measure-customer-satisfaction/">CSAT (customer satisfaction)</a> and one-touch ticket rates (<a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662256-Using-CSAT-Professional-and-Enterprise-">here&#8217;s how to measure CSAT in Zendesk</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the data you capture to inform your operational adjustments and priorities. Find your customers&rsquo; pain points and do what it takes to relieve them.</p>
<p>When Dave was working as a customer support manager, he learned that one of the product integrations was leading to a high number of support tickets. With Zendesk&rsquo;s software, he was able to track and organize tickets to investigate the issue. Agents used the drop-down menu on each support ticket to indicate what the conversation was about, and a time-tracking app recorded the amount of time spent on each ticket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were able to say to the product team, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s how much it costs us per month to support this feature,&rsquo;&rdquo; explains Dave. &ldquo;I think giving them that kind of hard data helped them justify spending money to make those product improvements.&rdquo;</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>

<section class="accent-tofu">
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-3">
<h2>Tip #4: Keep up with emerging communication channels</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="col col-small-1">
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<p>According to Zendesk&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/">2020 CX Trends Report</a>, less than 30% of companies offer self-service, live chat, social messaging, in-app messaging, bots, or peer-to-peer communities. The study also found that among millennial and Gen Z customers, 30% typically resolve issues through chat, and 40% regularly use messaging.</p>
<p>That represents a big opportunity for many companies to outflank their competition by offering more digital communication channels. At the same time, Sam cautions against adding new channels just for the sake of adding new channels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you just want to add chat, for example, because it&rsquo;s got a high CSAT score and you want a high CSAT score, you should back up a little bit,&rdquo; cautions Sam. &ldquo;Do you have the resources to man a very active live channel like that? Do you have the first reply time benchmarks that will meet the expectations of somebody who is chatting in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the CX data says your organization can&rsquo;t fully support a new channel, you may need to either increase your staff or temporarily stick with less intensive channels.</p>
<p>And even if you do have the bandwidth for multiple channels, keep your focus on the customer&rsquo;s expectations. Leverage customer data to see which platforms your audience actually likes and focus your energy on those.</p>

<h2>Explore your customer&rsquo;s perspective with CXM software</h2>
<p>You know your company has a lot of moving parts, but consider what it looks like from the outside. Do customers feel like they&rsquo;re getting passed around by different departments who aren&rsquo;t sharing information? Or are their concerns being understood, addressed, and even anticipated?</p>
<p>You need to oversee all aspects of CX. Zendesk Explore gives you insight into every customer interaction. It has pre-calculated common customer service metrics for you, so you&rsquo;re able to immediately measure and act on your customer data.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Staying connected to customers has always been important, but maintaining a connection that’s exclusively digital is easier said than done. Thankfully, living online and great customer experiences don’t have to be mutually exclusive. As part of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zendesk’s CX Moments</a>, a free virtual event series, three global brands recently shared how they are using technology, community, and purpose to drive their businesses forward—and to create and nurture those crucial ongoing connections.</p>
<h4>FabFitFun: Relationships and experiences go hand-in-hand</h4>
<p><a href="https://fabfitfun.com/get-the-box/?step=getbox&#038;#plan=fffvip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FabFitFun</a> aims to deliver a bit of happiness to everyone, regardless of where they are. And in tough times like these, a subscription box can offer a moment of brightness and excitement, according to Caitlin Logan, senior director of customer experience at FabFitFun. FabFitFun’s boxes include items related to beauty, fitness, wellness, and home decor—and when it comes to watching trends, identifying rising brands, and selecting the best or newest products to include in each box, “We do all of the heavy lifting,” Logan says. “All the members need to do is sign up. It comes to their house where they can just enjoy it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Staying connected to customers has always been important, but maintaining a connection that&#8217;s exclusively digital is easier said than done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some brand experiences are a one-time thing, FabFitFun offers an ongoing connection with their customers all year long. With boxes arriving quarterly, customers have ample time to get the most out of each product they’ve received, but also develop a sense of excitement around what’s coming in the next box. </p>
<p>Plus, FabFitFun employees actively engage with members on dedicated forums, where customers are able to offer more organic feedback. Through these forums, customers feel the brand truly cares about them and their opinions of the products they receive because the brand responds. Building community amongst your customers and encouraging them to engage with one another gives members a chance to really connect with your brand—and one another—more deeply, Logan shares.</p>

</center></p>
<h4>Four Pillars: Purpose drives the experience </h4>
<p>How a customer interacts with a brand is a process that is always changing. For <a href="https://www.fourpillarsgin.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Four Pillars</a>, an award-winning gin distillery based out of Melbourne, Australia, the experience a customer has with the product is everything. Co-founder Matt Jones explains that no matter how exceptional your product is, “this truly remarkable craft is nothing if we can’t translate that into experiences that build community and bring our customers on this journey with us.” When an excellent product and an unforgettable experience combine, customers are more likely to develop a fierce loyalty for the brand.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/stop-cx-moment-3-companies-taking-human-approach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop for a CX moment—3 companies taking a human approach</a>]</em></p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to think that a premium cocktail is something that can only be found in an expensive bar, stirred up by a bartender that’s dressed to the nines. For Jones and his fellow co-founders, the driving force behind building excellent, memorable customer experiences was to make quality ingredients more accessible. Before the pandemic, customers often visited the distillery as much for the experience as for the gin. More recently, the distillery has pivoted towards helping customers create a top notch cocktail with Four Pillars gin from the comfort of their own home—an empowering experience that offers a feeling of partnership between brand and customer. “Experiences build a lasting sense of loyalty and commitment,” says Jones.</p>

</center></p>
<h4>Xavier College: It’s never a bad idea to get a jumpstart on digital transformation</h4>
<p>Sometimes it’s easy to forget that educational establishments still have to run like a business. And core to that is providing a great educational experience.</p>
<p>Patrick Winter, head of Information, Communications and Technology at <a href="https://www.xavier.vic.edu.au/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xavier College</a>, was looking to enhance the experience the college was offering through better and more efficient technology. “We had a really traditional on-premises approach to our infrastructure and software, and we had a culture where face-to-face engagement was the norm and also really valued,” notes Winter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, living online and great customer experiences don&#8217;t have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With multiple campuses spread across Melbourne, Australia, efficiency was crucial. “We were finding that staff would rather travel 30 or 40 minutes to go to a meeting across town, rather than using video conferencing or a telephone call to be able to get that interpersonal exchange and experience.” By encouraging the use of more distance-friendly forms of communication, Winter hoped to cut down on time spent traveling between destinations while simultaneously promoting a more collaborative and digital environment.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.tv/articles/4-companies-talk-cx-changing-course-managing-expectations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4 companies talk CX, changing course, and managing expectations</a>]</em></p>
<p>When campuses were severely impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns and education was forced to move online, Winter was already 12 months deep into a major digital transformation. “Figuring out how we could take what they wanted, like face-to-face engagement, and just enhance that ability for them, was something we spent months and months going around and engaging people on.” Thanks to this earlier investment in infrastructure, both students and staff easily pivoted and embraced software that they’d already been introduced to and were starting to grow comfortable with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many startups, Zendesk was founded with the goal of democratizing technology. We saw the pain businesses were experiencing as they tried to serve their customers well with software that was clunky, oppressive, and required so much specialized training that only select individuals were really equipped to manage it. So we set about creating customer support software that would serve the needs of large companies and small businesses just getting off the ground alike, guided by a fundamental belief that access and inclusivity are key to building a successful business. </p>
<p>Accessibility is more than one of our business principles—it’s also a core value. </p>

  Given the increased complexity of voting in the midst of a pandemic, it’s more important than ever that people get the time off they need to vote.

<p>At Zendesk, we support safe, fair, and accessible elections in the U.S. and around the world. Which is why we’ve joined 1,000+ companies in the <a href="https://www.maketimetovote.org/pages/members" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Time to Vote</a> campaign, a nonpartisan movement led by the business community to increase voter participation in our country&#8217;s elections by shifting the focus of company culture to be more overtly supportive of each employee’s right and obligation to vote.</p>
<p>Given the increased complexity of voting in the midst of a pandemic, it’s more important than ever that people get the time off they need to vote. Despite the heavy emphasis on absentee and mail-in ballots this year, many Americans will nonetheless choose to vote in person. </p>
<p>According to the Pew Research Center, voter turnout in the U.S. is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the lowest in the developed world</a>. The most common reason people give for not voting is that they’re too busy or can’t take time off of work. </p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<p>To that end, this fall Zendesk made the following changes to company policy to ensure our employees can vote easily and safely on November 3rd: </p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. employees may take up to 2 hours without loss of pay to vote and leadership will be flexible in working with employees who vote in person </li>
<li>Exempt employees can use Take What You Need (TWYN) vacation time and non-exempt employees can use their volunteer time to vote and/or volunteer as poll workers</li>
<li>November 3 has been designated a ‘no internal meeting’ day</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope other companies will join us in committing to make time for employees to vote. This <strong>downloadable <a href="https://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/_Vote2020ElectionToolkit_one_pager.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">election toolkit</strong></a> offers resources on voting, volunteering, and mobilizing networks ahead of the November 3rd U.S. General Election.</p>
</div>
<p>How else can your company encourage awareness and participation in our democratic process? Led by Zendesk’s social impact team, we’re also:</p>
<ul>
<li>engaging on a dedicated “Vote-2020” Slack channel;</li>
<li>sharing social media templates and content so employees can mobilize their own networks to vote and volunteer;</li>
<li>rallying our customers and partners to join us in empowering employees and making time to vote.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For IT leaders, customer experience was already a hot topic, but the pandemic has amplified the importance of delivering a thoughtful and modern customer experience.  Today&#8217;s challenges bring into focus those attributes and hurdles that most directly tie to customer experience. In a nutshell, positive customer experience ties directly to revenue. Forrester, an independent research firm, found that “companies with superior CX [customer experience] grew revenues five time faster on average than their competitors with inferior CX.”<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> Companies strive to become customer experience leaders over laggards. However, there are a number of hurdles that prevent this evolution and it starts with IT.</p>
<h2>Understanding IT hurdles</h2>
<p>It is not as simple as to say, swap out legacy technology for modern technology and the problem is solved. It goes much deeper. IT’s legacy challenges require a change to culture, technology, data and silos. Each of these must change in their own ways.</p>
<p>Evolution of legacy IT thinking is the first step in the journey. It is important for IT to become more engaged with their line-of-business counterparts to more intimately understand the nature of their business, how it operates, and how and where it engages with customers. Taking a customer-first mantra for IT paired with this core business understanding creates the foundation a customer centric- company needs.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Taking a customer-first mantra for IT paired with this core business understanding creates the foundation a customer-centric company needs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Different parts of the company engage with customers, from marketing to sales to customer support and beyond. Each of these engagements provide an opportunity to create great customer experiences through the use of modern technology. Unfortunately, companies often rely on legacy technology that is limited in capability and flexibility. 81% of consumers will defect to another brand as a result of bad customer experiences.<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup> A fundamental change is needed.</p>
<h2>The power of IT paired with data</h2>
<p>IT provides the single greatest opportunity for change with regards to customer experience. IT provides the core foundation that all good customer experiences are built upon.</p>
<p>Customer experience leaders are striving for a ‘market of one’ and hyper-personalization for customers. This only comes through the use of modern technology paired with relevant customer data that can constantly adapt to a customer’s needs. A company’s technology choices must do the same…and at the same pace.</p>
<p>The sheer rate of change and volume of data is significantly increasing over time. Consequently, the underlying technology that parses and leverages the onslaught of data must remain flexible and accommodating. In the case of customer experience, we need to consider ways to provide seamless experiences for customers based on the underlying data as opposed to separate silos of data that are integrated.</p>
<p>The days of rigid, monolithic systems are behind us. Simply put, they just are not able to keep up nor provide the business guidance that today’s data provides. Of equal importance is that they are not able to provide positive engagement opportunities for modern customer experiences.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Leaders who recognize this opportunity are able to capitalize on the modern, unified customer experience that CX leaders and customers alike are clamoring for.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to provide consistent experiences, a business needs a view across each place a customer engages with a company. IT is in a unique position to see across the different points that customers engage with an organization. Leaders who recognize this opportunity are able to capitalize on the modern, unified customer experience that CX leaders and customers alike are clamoring for.</p>
<h2>Enabling the modern customer-centric organization</h2>
<p>Aligning to a customer-centric organization is critical for all parts of the company…including IT. Start by creating a culture that fully understands and embraces the customer. This goes hand-in-hand with the relationships between IT and non-IT organizations. Align to support employees that engage most directly with customers. Consider the technology that supports both customer-facing employees as well as technology which customers interface with directly.</p>
<p>Keep an eye to the future and where customers may be headed. It will never be a point. It will be a journey that meanders along a circuitous path and is constantly evolving. The organization, culture, technology and data need to adapt accordingly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you set off on a road trip, you have a vehicle and a road map. On this road map, you mark stops to take along the way.</p>
<p>Think of your sales process in the same way: The vehicle is your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/">CRM</a>, and the road map is your sales process. The steps along the way are the sales stages within your pipeline and CRM. Your final destination? Converting a deal into a customer. </p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Steps in the sales process" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/steps-in-the-sales-process-infographic-4.png" /></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/steps-in-the-sales-process-infographic-4.png">See larger image</a></p>
<p>Your sales team should receive this standardized road map on day one to keep sales reps from jumping haphazardly from one step to another. With a road map, your reps will know the specific route to their destination and how they&#8217;re each expected to get there. A step-by-step sales cycle helps sales managers more effectively track rep performance and determine which areas need support.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Prospecting" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/prospecting-header.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 1: Prospecting</h2>
<p>Prospecting is the first stage of your selling process. You&rsquo;re finding potential deals and entering them into your B2B sales funnel. The goal here is to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://auth0.com/blog/digital-success-through-customer-identity-and-access-management/">engage with qualified leads</a> who would most enjoy the benefits of your product or service.</p>
<p>Think of this first step as a vetting process on your end<em>. </em>You need to determine whether the potential client is the right match for your product, whether they have the budget, whether you can provide the value they need, and more.</p>
<p>Seek to answer this question: Is this deal worth it?</p>
<p>You can answer this question with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/fast-track-lead-generation-sell-reach/">customer-centric lead generation strategies</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <strong>Offer answers to specific problems on Quora.</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.quora.com">Quora</a> queries can help you identify companies or individuals who struggle with specific pain points that your product can solve.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>Interact with potential customers in LinkedIn Groups.</strong> Similar to interacting on Quora, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/">LinkedIn Groups</a> make it easy to make contact with ideal customers who struggle with key problems common to your target market.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>Create videos with a built-in lead-generation form.</strong> Video content helps attract interested inbound potential leads. Include an optional lead-generation form following the video to capture leads with a baseline level of engagement.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>Source leads from support-ticket conversations.</strong> Conversations with your support team offer information you can use to upsell existing customers. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amplitude.com/customer-retention">Repeat business</a> from your customer base is an easier climb than converting brand new customers.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>Offer a helpful email course.</strong> Educational email courses are a great way to nurture interested top-of-funnel leads until they become qualified enough to enter your sales pipeline and move on to Step 2.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This first step has an outsized impact on the success of the rest of your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/build-sales-crm-process/">sales strategy</a>. Build clear customer profiles for your reps so they know how to assess leads and determine whether they&rsquo;re interested in what you&#8217;re selling.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Qualified" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/qualified-header.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 2: Qualified</h2>
<p>The next stage is all about pulling in information about the potential customer. You&rsquo;ll use this information to personalize your sales pitch and present a tailored case for buying your product or service.</p>
<p>In this stage, you gather more details about the specific requirements the potential customer needs in a solution. You identify key decision-makers, confirm whether they can actually purchase or not, and then present the value of your product or service.</p>
<p>Set up an initial appointment or sales meeting. Find out whether the point of contact in the passenger seat is the one who is able to actually make the purchase. If they&#8217;re not, find out who is, and ask to meet with them as well.</p>
<p>After that initial meeting (or during, depending on what makes sense), present a demo of your product/service to the key decision-makers. Sell the potential customer on what you&#8217;re offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <strong>What are you doing better than competitors?</strong> Explain in detail how your product is better suited to the customer&rsquo;s needs than anyone else&rsquo;s is.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>How does your product/service add specific value to this particular customer?</strong> Show how and where your product will save them money or time. Explain how it will help them bring in more revenue. Wherever possible, include specific dollar or time measurements to help with handling objections.
  </li>
<li>
    <strong>What features of your product/service match customer needs?</strong> Connect each feature to the specific problem it solves for the customer.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The final key, once you&rsquo;ve finished presenting your case, is to give the potential customer a clear next step. Conclude with a compelling call to action (like signing up for a free trial or getting a time-limited discount). A good CTA gives leads a concrete way to move along in the buying process.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Quote" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/quote-header.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 3: Quote</h2>
<p>At this step in a good sales process, your customer relationship is ready to seriously discuss terms and prices.</p>
<p>In your discussions, be sure to clearly outline what features the potential customer will receive at what price. Your quote will be based on these discussions and should include the following terms, among other details:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><strong>Contract length: </strong>How long will the potential customer be locked into your product or service?</li>
<li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> How often will the customer pay you, and how much? What payment methods can they use?</li>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> Which features, support, and other details will the customer gain access to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Send a quote to the potential customer, and then wait for a confirmation. Remember, the quote serves as a starting point for negotiations. Nothing is set in stone until the next step, when you furnish a contract and close the deal.</p>
<p>If the client agrees to the terms of your quote, you can move to &ldquo;Closure&rdquo; and draw up the contract. If they say no, the sales journey is over&mdash;for now.</p>
<p>This step along your sales process also helps sales managers gauge rep performance. Are reps actually sending quotes? Are quote opportunities being missed? Do sales reps follow up with potential customers often enough?</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Closure" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/closure-header.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 4: Closure</h2>
<p>Once a potential customer agrees to the terms of your quote, it&rsquo;s time to negotiate final terms and officially close the deal with a contract.</p>
<p>This is the step where success (or failure) most directly affects revenue. If you don&#8217;t close deals, you don&#8217;t make money for your company.</p>
<p>Present an agreement that is mutually beneficial to both you and the customer. This contract should outline the terms of the deal (pricing and payment terms, features, and access) and reiterate the value of your product and the problem it will solve for the lead.</p>
<p>During this step, push comes to shove, and you&rsquo;ll find out whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ve reached the true decision-maker(s)</li>
<li>Reps have adequately communicated value</li>
<li>The customer will move forward with closure and a deal</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for sales professionals to view this step as being as much a part of the sales process as the first three. Until you have a signed agreement in hand, you&rsquo;re still selling and communicating value to the potential customer.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Won and Lost" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/won-lost-header.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 5: Won/Lost</h2>
<p>Ideally, reaching Step 5 means you&rsquo;ve won the deal, and the lead is now a bonafide customer. If that&rsquo;s the case, this is the time for sales management and reps to identify what went right throughout each previous step. From there, you can extrapolate learnings to help make every sales process go as smoothly.</p>
<p>At this stage, you also want to communicate the deal terms to customer support so they can smoothly continue the buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>If the deal is lost, Step 5 is still important. Losing deals is a major opportunity to review your sales process steps. Determine where a step was missed or poorly executed, and plan how you&rsquo;ll make improvements for the next deal.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a lost deal doesn&rsquo;t have to be lost forever: you can always restart or continue the sales process down the line.</p>
<p>Maybe you just need to take a detour. If a key factor changes&mdash;like the lead&rsquo;s budget expanding&mdash;you may move the deal back to either Qualified or Quote and continue working on winning this project. Don&#8217;t abandon the journey until you&#8217;re absolutely certain that you can&#8217;t make it to the final destination.</p>
<h2>Tailor your sales process steps for your customers</h2>
<p>The next step for your sales process is to monitor how it works for your team and your customers. If needed, you can tinker with each step or the process as a whole from there.</p>
<p>To do that, review data regularly to find at which sales steps deals get stuck or where you lose potential customers. Choosing a CRM that allows you to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041517313">customize your sales pipeline stages</a> is also beneficial. For example, you may need a stop/stage to move &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo; deals. Or you may need to reorder stages, depending on your business.</p>
<p>A good CRM will give you the flexibility to reorder, rename, and add or delete stages. That way, you can review your defined sales process or road map every few months and make changes as needed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of companies react to growth pressures by trimming their customer support budget. That may provide some quick breathing room, but it&rsquo;s not a prudent long-term solution.</p>
<p>After all, it&rsquo;s cheaper to retain a customer than to acquire a new one. And when <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">we polled consumers</a> on what factors inspire the most brand loyalty, <strong>57% cited good customer service</strong>, making it second only to price.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are ways to invest in better customer service without ballooning the budget. Simple changes and small initiatives can have an outsized impact on the customer experience.</p>
<p>We asked our own CX experts which of the smallest adjustments make the biggest differences. If you&rsquo;re wondering how to improve customer experience without committing too much time and money, here are five simple tactics that you can get started on right away.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Don’t leave customers in the dark" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/dont-leave-customers-in-the-dark.png" /></p>
<h2>1. Don&rsquo;t leave customers in the dark</h2>
<p>Give customers a heads-up about how their customer service experience will play out to avoid frustration down the road.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-reuter-0b02383a/">Brian Reuter</a>, Director of Customer Success at Zendesk, says it&#8217;s best to set expectations about the best way to interact and get support from your company:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;If you send an email into my support team or my success team, and I give you an immediate response that says, &lsquo;we typically get back to you in about four hours,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re much less likely to get frustrated.&rdquo;<br />
  <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-reuter-0b02383a/">Brian Reuter</a>, Director of Customer Success at Zendesk</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Without any guidance, a customer might expect to hear back right away and get more annoyed the longer they wait.</p>
<p>Send automatic emails establishing clear timelines for a response, and tell callers on hold how many customers are ahead of them. If you have to get back to someone with a follow-up call or email, let them know when they can expect the next exchange.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a good practice for support teams but also for all customer-facing departments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same goes for customer success or sales,&rdquo; says Brian. &ldquo;Just be clear with what your expectations are so that you can be on the same page, and the customer doesn&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re in the dark waiting on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Talk to people who know your customers" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/talk-to-people-who-know-customers.png" /></p>
<h2>2. Talk to the people who know your customers best</h2>
<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/best-customer-support-metrics/">customer service metrics</a> you can (and should) track and analyze to improve the overall customer experience.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a good idea to regularly ask your staff for qualitative feedback. After all, they have firsthand knowledge of the most common customer complaints.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;Your customer facing teams are going to have a good feel for what the biggest customer pain points are. Do a stand up and ask, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the worst part of our customer experience?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
  <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-dyson/">Dave Dyson</a>, Senior Customer Service Evangelist at <em>Zendesk</em></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem might not have an easy fix, but talking to your team can at least help you better understand what&rsquo;s really at stake and what needs to be done about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That conversation can point you in a direction that you can then use data to verify and build a case for improvement,&rdquo; adds Dave.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s important that you follow through &mdash; either by acting on your agents&rsquo; advice or letting them know why you&rsquo;re not able to implement changes at the moment. Update your team on what you&rsquo;re doing with their insights. Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re not really interested in what they have to say.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Next Issue Avoidance" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/next-issue-avoidance.png" /></p>
<h2>3. Embrace a &ldquo;Next Issue Avoidance&rdquo; strategy</h2>
<p>Want a simple way to save your customers <em>and</em> agents some time? Reduce the number of necessary follow-ups with the Next Issue Avoidance (NIA) strategy &mdash; a good tactic for predicting and addressing likely customer problems.</p>
<p>At Zendesk, our NIA system involves proactively sending customers additional articles about topics related to their original issue.</p>

  &ldquo;We say, &lsquo;Hey, a lot of people who experienced X have always experienced Y and Z, so here&rsquo;s some information just in case that happens to you in the future.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
  <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-vandewalle-gore-2a56a38/">Holly VandeWalle-Gore</a>, Director of Training and Quality Assurance at Zendesk Global Customer Advocacy</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>A good NIA strategy shows customers you&rsquo;re really engaged in getting them all the help they need. It also spares your support staff from spending more time and energy on future follow-ups.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Prioritize" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/get-priorities-straight.png" /></p>
<h2>4. Get your priorities straight</h2>
<p>One small change that&rsquo;s had a big impact at Zendesk? Switching from a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; support process to one that prioritizes complex issues over simple ones.</p>
<p>Holly compares it to the self-checkout line at the grocery store. If you&rsquo;re just buying a box of mac and cheese, you don&rsquo;t want to get stuck waiting behind the shopper with vodka and limes who needs an employee to come over to weigh her produce and check her ID.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how a lot of our tickets were &mdash; we had a lot of people who had somewhat simple issues that were waiting behind somebody who had a much more difficult and challenging problem,&rdquo; says Holly.</p>
<p>So instead, Zendesk is now prioritizing support issues via our most popular customer communication channel: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/chat/">live chat</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We opened up chat to anybody who wanted to use it, instead of charging more for it, and now we&rsquo;re getting to a point where we&rsquo;ve started differentiating the type of issue,&rdquo; explains Holly.</p>
<p>Zendesk now has a system in place for determining what <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/set-support-tiers/">tier of support</a> is required for each ticket.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;If a ticket meets one of five criteria, then it will go straight to a chat person. But if it&rsquo;s beyond those five things, that chat person will have a stopping point when they say, &lsquo;okay, this is actually requiring another level of support.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
  <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-vandewalle-gore-2a56a38/">Holly VandeWalle-Gore</a>, Director of Training and Quality Assurance at Zendesk Global Customer Advocacy</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The system guarantees that every customer receives an initial response at the same speed. But the customers who have more complex issues are then routed to a second layer of support.</p>
<p>Customers typically don&rsquo;t like being transferred or having multiple touchpoints. That&rsquo;s why we take pains to ensure that they&rsquo;re getting a more intensive level of support due to their unique circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure you get the right level of expertise, and we want to make sure that you get the right person,&rdquo; is how Holly frames it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to prepare the customers for that experience, and let them know that this is not a penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Don’t take customer loyalty for granted" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/dont-take-customer-loyalty-for-granted.png" /></p>
<h2>5. Don&rsquo;t take customer loyalty for granted</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about retention, it pays to find simple ways to recognize and reward customers for their brand loyalty.</p>
<p>This can be anything from a financial incentive to just a simple thank you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say, &lsquo;Hey, thank you so much for shopping with us for five years,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;I see this is your 30th order with us,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Holly.</p>
<p>If a customer&rsquo;s support issue is especially time-consuming or frustrating, just fixing it for them may not be enough. A free gift card or a discount on their next purchase may be what they need to forget the ordeal.</p>
<p>Companies often invite their best customers to a &ldquo;preview night&rdquo; for new product launches so that they can be among the first to find out what&rsquo;s new. You can also invite your most loyal customers to trial a new offer before it goes to market. They&rsquo;ll appreciate the exclusive opportunity, and their feedback may include some legitimately valuable customer insights.</p>
<h2>One more way to improve customer experience</h2>
<p>There are lots of simple, straightforward things you can do to improve a customer&rsquo;s experience. But if you&rsquo;re still looking for that <em>one</em> thing that will make all the difference, you may want to look into a comprehensive software solution that helps manage every aspect of the customer experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/#features">Zendesk Support</a> is a simple and streamlined solution for tracking, prioritizing, and solving your company&rsquo;s customer support tickets. Businesses that use the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/features/customer-experience-software/">Zendesk Explore</a> add-on to measure and improve their CX solve <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">3.4 times as many tickets</a> as companies that don&rsquo;t&mdash;and their customers spend 53% less time waiting for agents to respond.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James M. Kerr called his newest book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/INDISPENSABLE-Build-Company-Customers-Without/dp/1630061832/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&#038;keywords=indispensable+james+kerr&#038;qid=1601478002&#038;sr=8-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indispensable: How to Build and Lead a Company Customers Can’t Live Without</a></em>. But he probably should have called it “How to Build and Lead a Company Customers <em>Don’t Want</em> to Live Without.” The big distinction is that there are some companies that provide a service that seems essential, but the way the company operates makes customers yearn for an alternative. For example, if the evidence presented in Netflix’s <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a></em> is accurate, Facebook made itself indispensable by hacking into its customers’ neurological wiring and getting people hooked on a brain chemistry cocktail comprising a need for constant attention, tribalism, and outrage. Many customers <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/want-to-delete-facebook-read-what-happened-to-these-people-first-2018-07-27" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would drop Facebook in a heartbeat</a> if a more benevolent platform could take its place in terms of  connection, fundraising, events, and gathering their friends and family. </p>
<p>Even Amazon, which has proven itself indispensable in terms of providing everything people could need almost instantly, especially during the pandemic, became indispensable through a very positive lazer focus on knowing customers even better than they know themselves. But its famous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">toxic environment</a> makes many customers feel uneasy about using it. Kerr is a huge believer in building the kind of company customers <em>don’t want</em> to live without. And that starts with leaders who are committed to being decent human beings toward customers, employees, and the community. Bezos <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/21/is-amazon-unstoppable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was quoted</a> for asking employees, “Are you lazy, or just incompetent?” By contrast, Kerr quotes Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf who said: “Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without strategy.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many customers would drop Facebook in a heartbeat if a more benevolent platform could take its place in terms of  connection, fundraising, events, and gathering their friends and family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Of course, you don’t have to disrupt an industry to become an indispensable business,” Kerr wrote in his book. “Instead, you must be driven to excellence in all that you do and to deliver what your customers want. In essence, you want to be on a constant lookout for ways to unlock your customer’s potential…. The key to unlocking that potential in your customers lies with the leadership and culture of your organization. These are the keys needed to differentiate you from your competitors. These are the things that will enable you to be the <em>provider of choice</em> in the hearts and minds of your customers.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/best-disruptors-offer-cool-new-platform-product/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The best disruptors offer more than a cool new platform or product</a>]</em></p>
<h4>The decent company</h4>
<p>In his book, Kerr lists many examples of companies that failed because their leaders forgot they were in stewardship roles and made it all about themselves: they made excuses; they copped out of their responsibility to others. And he lists companies that made hard choices for the good of the company and it paid off. In a <a href="https://ceoworld.biz/2020/09/26/bringing-common-decency-back-to-business/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent article</a> about bringing decency back to business, Kerr urged that leaders need to remember some basic principles including: “It’s not about you,” “stop needing to win so much,” and “use the decency acid test: ask yourself, <em>Did I do what I thought was the right thing to do? Did I do my best?</em>”</p>
<p>“Companies are living organisms,” Kerr said in an interview. “They have a heartbeat, and it’s driven by what the leadership team does. So, what excites the leadership team? Maybe it gets excited by the customer; maybe it only gets excited by profits. The leadership team is providing an example.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Ask yourself, <em>&#8216;Did I do what I thought was the right thing to do? Did I do my best?&#8217;</em>&#8221; — James M. Kerr</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Looking at the company as a whole</h4>
<p>Good leadership, what Kerr calls “right leadership,” is part of several key choices including “right vision” and “right mindset”—without which you can’t make your company indispensable. Before COVID-19, for example, many companies were way behind on digital transformation. Kerr said many companies he interacted with were not making good use of their CRM systems because employees didn’t update them. When asked why, employees explained it took too long and the system was too complicated. This wasn’t a tech problem, Kerr said. It was a mindset problem, because people didn’t have the mindset that meeting customers needs, whatever it took, was the priority. Leadership didn’t take care of leading the right mindset, and possibly they weren’t looking out for employees by providing an intuitive system to help employees meet customers’ needs. And ultimately, customers were at the bottom of the list of priorities in this scenario. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/unlearning-latest-must-skill-startup-ceo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8216;Unlearning&#8217; as the latest must-have skill for any startup CEO</a>]</em></p>
<p>“You’ve got to get your leadership team right first, then get your vision together, then get people to support it,” he said. “You can’t become indispensable if you can’t articulate what you’re trying to become. And everybody you’re bringing into the company has to understand that and be part of it. You have to make them promises and deliver on those promises…. You’ve got to make sure your culture isn’t cutthroat, help people be their best, make sure the right kinds of things are baked into administration of the company so employees are empowered to get work done the best way they can.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t become indispensable if you can&#8217;t articulate what you&#8217;re trying to become. And everybody you&#8217;re bringing into the company has to understand that and be part of it.&#8221; — James M. Kerr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book, Kerr said, pulls together all the elements he’s encountered over and over in decades of consulting on management, leadership, organizational design. It outlines a process for examining the company, beginning with the idea that the customer is the reason for being and common decency is the foundation. His frameworks, he said, let companies continually evolve using systems and approaches companies can repeat and apply to a lot of different situations. It’s not one idea, one strategy, or one killer product. It’s a way of being as a company.</p>
<p>“Not any one of those things will delight a customer,” he said. “It’s all of them in unison.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across industries, people tend to fall into the habit of using acronyms to describe common concepts they encounter. Customer service representatives are no exception.</p>
<p>But anyone new to the industry or trying to understand it from the outside, acronyms make communication confusing and difficult. And even people who have worked in customer service for years may still come across the occasional acronym that leaves them scratching their heads.</p>
<p>For people who want to understand the world of customer service better, getting to know the common customer service acronyms experienced professionals throw around is valuable.</p>
<h2>30 common customer service acronyms</h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re a brand new customer support representative, an experienced customer service manager, or a member of a sales team trying to make sense out of your communications with customer service. Whatever your role, bookmarking this list of customer service and call center acronyms can help you more effectively communicate with your colleagues.</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li><strong>AHT &#8211;</strong> AHT stands for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/average-handle-time/">average handle time</a>, a metric that tracks how long it typically takes to solve a customer service ticket. Many customer support departments use it to track how well agents are doing at providing a speedy response to customers.</li>
<li><strong>AI &#8211;</strong> A common shortening for artificial intelligence, AI is a hot topic in the business world in general, and often comes up in the context of technological customer support tools. For example, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/guide/features/customer-portal-software/ai-chatbot/">chatbots</a> that employ AI can take a portion of customer service work off the shoulders of human agents.</li>
<li><strong>BI &#8211;</strong> BI, or business intelligence, is the term tied to the process of using technology to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-experience-support-data/">collect data relevant to the business</a>, and then turning it into actionable insights. Customer service software and the data it produces makes up just one part of BI, but it&rsquo;s important for allowing management to gain visibility into the customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>CEM &#8211;</strong> CEM stands for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-experience-management-matters/">customer experience management</a>, the collection of processes, tasks, and tools a business deploys to understand and improve the customer journey. A key part of CEM is gaining a single view of the different interactions a customer has with a brand and how they all connect, so you can understand their larger customer experience.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CMS &#8211;</strong> In the world of customer service and particularly in call centers, this stands for call management system. It&rsquo;s a central piece of call center technology that helps agents more efficiently handle large volumes of calls.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">Be warned: CMS is an acronym where context really matters. Its most common business use is to describe a content management system, which may include a customer service knowledge base. And for customer service representatives in the U.S. who work in government or healthcare, it&rsquo;s most common use will be Center for Medicaid and Medicare services. Anytime you use it, make sure which meaning you intend will be clear to your audience.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CRM &#8211;</strong> CRM stands for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-crm-2917373">customer relationship management</a>, the practice of working to understand and effectively manage relationships from a person&rsquo;s first interaction with the company through their entire time as customers.</p>
<p>In practice, CRM is often used to describe the software used for customer relationship management, rather than the practice itself. A CRM system is a technological product that enables companies to effectively track and handle all aspects of customer relationships, throughout the full customer journey.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>CRO &#8211;</strong> Conversion rate optimization, or CRO, is the process of designing online experiences in a way that increases the percentage of people that take the desired action. While the term is used more often in sales and marketing contexts, it can also apply in some customer service scenarios.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662256-Using-CSAT-Professional-and-Enterprise-"><strong>CSAT</strong></a><strong> &#8211;</strong> A shortening of the term customer satisfaction, CSAT is used to describe a score produced from providing customers with a short survey asking them to rate their service experience.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CSS</strong> &#8211; In the customer service industry, CSS stands for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/self-service/">customer self service</a>, a type of customer support that&rsquo;s focused on providing customers with the information they need to solve their own problems. It includes resources such as a thorough customer help center or AI chatbot that allow customers to find an answer without having to talk to a person.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">Be warned: A more common usage of CSS, especially in technological fields, is to describe the programming language cascading style sheets. If programmers or developers are in your audience, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll think of when they hear this acronym.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>CTA &#8211;</strong> A CTA, or call to action, is the language used to encourage a prospect or customer to take a specific step. Common examples include &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; or &ldquo;learn more.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>CTI &#8211;</strong> Computer-telephony integration is any type of product that enables companies to integrate their phone and digital interactions in one interface.</li>
<li><strong>CTR &#8211;</strong> CTR is a shortening of click-through rate, the percentage of clicks that a link gets, as compared to the number of views it has. While the metric is more common in marketing than customer service, it can be a useful measure for determining how well support articles are performing.</li>
<li><strong>CX &#8211;</strong> A common way of shortening the phrase <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">customer experience</a>, CX is a term that&rsquo;s used to describe taking a larger look at how a customer perceives and interacts with a brand than simply their customer service interactions. Providing excellent customer service is one part of the overall customer experience, and many brands are working to gain a broader view of customer success.</li>
<li><strong>EOD &#8211;</strong> A general business term, EOD means end of day. It&rsquo;s most often used to clarify deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>EOL &#8211;</strong> End of life is a term used to describe when a piece of technology, or a particular version of a piece of technology, will no longer be supported by a company. That can include no longer providing customer support for it.</li>
<li><strong>FCR &#8211;</strong> <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/first-contact-resolution-friend-foe-frenemy/">First contact resolution,</a> or first call resolution in the call center context, is a metric that tracks how often customer issues are solved during their first interaction with a representative.</li>
<li><strong>HR &#8211;</strong> HR, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.csn.edu/hr-acronyms-and-commonly-used-terms">human resources </a>is the department in a business devoted to hiring, training, and managing employee benefits and complaints. While most of customer service is focused on helping the external customer, HR representatives often see their job as providing internal customer service.</li>
<li><strong>KB &#8211;</strong> KB stands for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/5-knowledge-base-design-best-practices/">knowledge base</a>, a collection of resources on a particular topic. For businesses, internal knowledge bases are used to store and organize important business information. External knowledge bases can be set up to help enable customer self service.</li>
<li><strong>KPI &#8211;</strong> KPIs, or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-kpis-need-track/">key performance indicators</a>, are the metrics a company or department chooses to prioritize in order to track progress on their primary goals.</li>
<li><strong>NPS &#8211;</strong> NPS stands for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/nps-software/">net promoter score</a>, an important customer service metric produced by sending customers a survey asking them to numerically select how likely they are to recommend the brand. It produces data customer service departments can use to measure overall <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/details/customer-success-software/">customer success</a>.</li>
<li><strong>QA &#8211;</strong> QA, or quality assurance, is the overall process a company puts into place to avoid any errors or issues with their products and services. It can include inspecting inventory to ensure it works as expected, doing user testing for a software product, or tracking and analyzing customer service metrics.</li>
<li><strong>ROI &#8211;</strong> Return on investment, frequently shortened to ROI, is a business term used to measure how well the amount spent on products and labor is paying off in terms of profits.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS &#8211;</strong> Software-as-a-Service is a business model based on selling a subscription to a piece of technology that will be renewed monthly or yearly.</li>
<li><strong>SBR &#8211;</strong> <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/skills-based-routing-route-way-success/">Skills-based routing</a>, sometimes shortened to SBR, is a technique customer service departments can use to ensure each ticket gets sent to the most appropriate agent, based on their strengths and skills.</li>
<li><strong>SMB &#8211;</strong> This acronym describes the business category that includes small and medium-sized businesses. It&rsquo;s often used to distinguish between them and enterprise businesses.</li>
<li><strong>SLA &#8211;</strong> A <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/keeping-word-support-sla/">service level agreement</a>, or SLA, is a written statement of the standards a customer service team commits to. It&rsquo;s a useful tool for incentivizing customer service agents to perform at the highest level.</li>
<li><strong>UX &#8211;</strong> A shortened way to say user experience, UX describes an area of design focused on ensuring that websites, software, and apps are intuitive and user friendly. UX has an influence on the overall CX.</li>
<li><strong>UI &#8211;</strong> The user interface is the part of a software the user interacts with directly. It plays a key role in UX, and how well it&rsquo;s designed can influence how often customers need help from support versus being able to figure out how to use a product on their own.</li>
<li><strong>VOIP</strong> &#8211; Voice over Internet Protocol is the technology that allows people to make phone calls using broadband internet. It&rsquo;s a common feature in modern customer service contact centers.</li>
<li><strong>WOM &#8211;</strong> WOM, or word of mouth is what your customers and prospects have to say about your brand. Building positive word of mouth is one of the best signs of customer service success.</li>
</ol>
<h2>When to use (and not use) customer service acronyms</h2>
<p>Customer service acronyms can function as time savers anytime you&rsquo;re communicating with someone in the know. But if you use them in the wrong context, they can become a barrier to communication.</p>
<p>Many of the acronyms a co-worker understands will cause confusion if you use them with a customer. And some common customer service phrases can&rsquo;t be reasonably shortened to an acronym without being confused for other common terms. For example, CS could mean <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/6-tips-best-online-customer-support/">customer support</a>, customer success, customer service, or even computer science.</p>
<p>While customer service acronyms are valuable to know, in many cases you&rsquo;re better off spelling what you mean to say. Knowing when and how to use them is at least as important as knowing their meaning.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Keeping up with customer expectations is vital to your business — and that means your support operations need to be nimble. Does your support software allow your team to easily add new channels? Or enable your agents to easily switch between channels keeping customer context? If not, it might be time to consider a switch. [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping up with customer expectations is vital to your business — and that means your support operations need to be nimble. Does your support software allow your team to easily add new channels? Or enable your agents to easily switch between channels keeping customer context? If not, it might be time to consider a switch.</p>
<p>Here are four ways Zendesk can help you deliver great customer service (and make your life easier).</p>
<h2>1. Zendesk is easy to set up and customize</h2>
<p>Zendesk can be set up quickly. It takes days — not months — to get up and running. What’s more, it works out of the box (meaning you can do it yourself, without the help of costly developers). That saves you time and money, and lets your agents focus on creating great CX instead of spending a lot of time training.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/stanley-black-decker/">Stanley Black and Decker</a> implemented a full omnichannel solution in only 3 weeks.</h3>
<p>The Stanley Black and Decker teams handle an average of 10,000 tickets each month, so speed of implementation was vital. Within three weeks of signing off on a suite of Zendesk products, the globally distributed Stanley Black and Decker support teams were up and running on all channels after only a single day of training.</p></div>
<h2>2. You’re not alone: our experts are here to help</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about switching to a new support solution, you’re probably wondering how you’ll get it started. Zendesk can help you make the transition easier and quicker, now matter if you’re new to CX software or a seasoned pro. Here are a few examples of how we can work together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community support: </strong>If you want to set up on your own, we make it easy to find helpful resources and connect with other companies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">The Help Center </a></strong>— our Knowledge Base and Community — is free and accessible for every customer.
<li><strong>The Knowledge Center</strong> is a library of product documentation, best practices, advice, and troubleshooting tips. With our Community, you can discover new workflows, customizations, and get direct set-up advice from our team of Community Moderators.</li>
<li><strong>Live coaching:</strong> Need a little more help? We’ll work with you to save you time on figuring out how to get started. You can get focused 1:1 live coaching from Zendesk experts through Expert Help on everything from rolling out new features to learning how to do things in the app.</li>
<li><strong>Professional services:</strong> If your needs are more complex, our Professional Services team can make the switch for you. Our team can help you migrate from existing tools, connect external systems, build custom apps, or set up a complex workflow. That means less worrying and fiddling with the tool, and getting up and running faster.</li>
</ul>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3>When <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/vimeo/">Vimeo </a>outgrew its old support software, our team helped them make a seamless transition.</h3>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been super impressed with Customer Success at Zendesk. The team is incredible and plays a significant role in Vimeo Support growing with the business. They steer us in the right direction and make us consider actions that might benefit us while serving as internal advocates.” &#8211; Suri Ratnatunga, Senior Director of Community and Support, Vimeo</p></div>
<h2>3. Zendesk creates better agent experiences (and better CX)</h2>
<p>With other solutions, agents have to toggle between different interfaces for omnichannel service, which is frustrating and inefficient. Zendesk gives agents a unified customer view with ticket fields, macros, sidebar apps, and more. We bring it all together in one customer profile, with a history of communications across all channels.</p>
<p>This puts all the information your agents need under a single pane of glass, making it easier to create great customer experiences. And, instead of searching for that data across different tools and applications, agents have it when they need it — allowing them to respond faster to customers and resolve issues more quickly.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/showpo/">Showpo </a>switched to Zendesk because Freshdesk’s multiple interfaces were frustrating.</h3>
<p>“When we were on Freshdesk, an agent would have eight, nine, ten different tabs open — DHL, Australia Post, Magento, all these different tabs,” Waddy said. “Our goal is to integrate those into Zendesk.” — Paul Waddy, Head of Operations
</p></div>
<h2>4. Zendesk gives you quick time to value</h2>
<p>When change is the only constant, you can&#8217;t afford to spend a ton of time and money implementing bulky, complicated systems. Zendesk delivers a lower cost of ownership due to its ease of setup, ease of customization, and ease of administration. Many companies find that Zendesk pays for itself in as little as 3 months. Here are the top three reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quick and easy setup:</strong> With Zendesk, it takes days or weeks, not months or years, to get set up and running. And because of our intuitive agent workspace, your team can onboard on Zendesk in just a few hours.</li>
<li><strong>Easy customization: </strong>Between our 1,000+ out-of-the box integrations and powerful APIs, most customers are able to extend and customize Zendesk to their own unique needs. What’s more, they can usually customize without the support of expensive outside consultants. That saves time and money.</li>
<li><strong>Easy administration: </strong>Our admin needs are minimal, unlike legacy platforms that need teams of expensive dedicated admins and developers. This helps you quickly respond to changing needs and customer expectations. So you spend less time and resources on administrative tasks, and more time with your customers.</li>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3>After Verimatrix switched to Zendesk, they saw quick return on investment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>612% ROI projected over 5 years with 3.4 month payback</li>
<li>10% increase in agent productivity</li>
<li>31% more tickets handled with the same number of agents</li>
<li>$822,000 per year in savings as a result of productivity increase</li>
<li>$565,000 per year in additional savings for eliminating the need to hire 7 additional people</li>
<li>99 CSAT Score</li>
<li>3-months to deploy and migrate (70,000 support tickets and 10-years worth of data / legacy articles)</li>

<h2>Zendesk was built for agility.</h2>
<p>Zendesk is an open and flexible platform purposefully built for scale and to drive the most business impact. With the right expertise, capability depth, and value, Zendesk can empower you to deliver great service that drives customer loyalty and satisfaction, while giving you the tools to set your agents up for success and control to run your unique business successfully at the best ROI.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Zendesk, my team and I are going beyond adjusting for the new normal. We are taking this difficult time as an opportunity to completely reimagine how we work. </p>
<p>Covid-19 forced us on a journey to reenvision and realign our practices, tools, and services. This is no small task, either in terms of logistics or impact: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/gartner-9-predictions-post-covid-future-of-work/">As Gartner predicts</a>, “the habits employees and managers are forming now will have a long tail and influence the way organizations operate for years to come.” Reimagining how we work is a massive undertaking. Where do you even start? </p>
<h2>A guiding principle: digital first, virtual everyday</h2>
<p>We are grounding our efforts firmly in the idea that digital and virtual are now key drivers for our workforce, our workplace, and how we work. To be digital first and virtual, we have to evolve our mindsets and our services. Automation, tools, and technology are allowing us to create a level and transparent access point for all employees globally—24/7. </p>
<h2>How infrastructure and our people practices line up</h2>
<p>Our focus on the new human interactions between leaders, their teams, and the business is an outcome of amazing tools: The work of Human Resources Business Partners has shifted. We are in the midst of aligning our infrastructure and our people practices to reimagine and define how to go from synchronous to asynchronous. When we think about asynchronous, we’re considering the big picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone may be remote, working in all different places and time zones, alone</li>
<li>Yet communication and collaboration are the lifeblood of any successful company</li>
<li>How do we make sure it all comes together?</li>
</ul>
<h2>The types of tools employees need</h2>
<p>We are looking at our Workplace—collaboration centers, our work evolving from process drivers to allowing tools and automation to work so we can focus on innovation and being creative. Collaborating employees must be able to use tools, systems and automation—to be able to do analysis or whiteboarding or big brainstorming. Tools that are needed are always on, creating ease of use and acting as a record to listen to our employees and customers. To create that environment, digitizing our work is essential.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>Onboarding, reborn</h2>
<p>As new employees have joined, we’ve had to shift from a process based in face-to-face interaction to digital first—these days we are no longer handing someone a laptop and sending them to two days of orientation in a conference room. </p>
<p>We’ve further strengthened the partnership between our Workplace and IT teams to ensure a smooth workflow, straightforward processes, and a seamless experience for new employees. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start the provisioning process with details that are automatically populated from the human resources tool Workday</li>
<li>New-hire training is now done virtually through an online learning platform, augmented by institutional knowledge captured in the employee knowledge base, built with Zendesk Guide</li>
</ul>
<p>With these shifts, the onboarding process has taken on a new uniformity, and employees are better equipped to get the help they need on their own. </p>
</div>
<h2>Zendesk products support Zendesk employees</h2>
<p>We also use our own products to provide ongoing support. </p>
<ul>
<li>Employees can use our AI-enabled chat bot to find answers in the knowledge base</li>
<li>They can file a ticket in Zendesk Support to get assistance from 24-hour shared services teams across the company</li>
<li>Built-in workflow automation and tracking tools let everyone involved see who’s responsible, who’s a stakeholder, and what the status of the ticket is</li>
</ul>
<h2>Collaboration and learning: transparent and democratized</h2>
<p>Teamwork no longer hinges on contact with the person you sit next to. Formal learning and institutional knowledge are getting shared mainly over informal Slack and Zoom calls. As we develop this concept of digital first and virtual everyday with remote as a core, one of our requirements is having systems and tools that allow everyone around the world to have the same experience. </p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;We have to democratize access to institutional knowledge—this will be a critical driver of productivity.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>-Mechele Neeley-Scholis, VP, Head of Global HR Business Partnering</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2020/knowledge-management-strategy.html">Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends Survey, 2020</a>, 75 percent of surveyed organizations say creating and preserving knowledge across evolving workforces is important or very important for their success over the next 12 to 18 months. </p>
<h2>Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing: centralized</h2>
<p>Employees simply need a single, central place where they can go to get answers. We can’t have random Google docs going out over email that will inevitably get lost, especially if those emails contain important information like back-to-work policies and new employee benefits. </p>
<p>Core to what we do across our People and Places teams: We lead teams that engage with our global employees to advance our culture and to create amazing experiences for our employees. </p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;HRBP roles are evolving to a place where we are intimate in understanding our employees&#8217; needs and career aspirations so they can grow with the shifts of the teams and the growth of Zendesk.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>-Mechele Neeley-Scholis, VP, Head of Global HR Business Partnering</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h2>A laser focus on what matters</h2>
<p>We have time to work with our leaders to advance their approaches to align with the new way of working by focusing their engagements on:</p>
<ul>
<li>outcomes</li>
<li>employee wellness</li>
<li>flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not looking at how much time you are at your desk to assess growth and value. This in itself is a shift: We are learning to move away from using meetings to communicate information and rather use meetings to have the necessary discussions that drive collaboration, time to innovate and create. We are no longer meeting to review slides. </p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;We are not looking at how much time you are at your desk to assess growth and value.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>-Mechele Neeley-Scholis, VP, Head of Global HR Business Partnering</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This also means reducing meetings. When we come together as a company or team, the purpose must be superclear. With the new distribution of our workforce in the office and home, flexibility is a must. It is a requirement to help in the new way to work.</p>
<h2>Slack and Zoom: the new office</h2>
<p>In support of these aims, we are using Slack more, to inform and to make engagement more meaningful. Slack is the new office and has become the new cool place to hang out. It is that living space where we now catch up with colleagues to have those watercooler chats, only virtually, of course. <strong>Zoom, like Slack, has long been a part of our work lives at Zendesk, but we have upped the bells and whistles available to us</strong>. </p>
<p>For instance, more reactions. We’re learning how to create emotion through Zoom. More and more, we’re exploring ways to use tools in a way that’s deeper and multidimensional. Engagement in the big, company-wide or department-wide meetings of the past was minimal. There’s more awareness now. Many more of us now have played the role of the presenter—and through the positive and also uncomfortable experiences in that, we’ve learned how to interact better virtually. <strong>When we meet in these virtual rooms, we need to be mindful and enable individuals to be heard, and seek out voices of differing opinions.</strong> This helps build psychological safety and trust, which is especially critical in being remote and distributed. </p>
<h2>The power of self-service</h2>
<p>Here we also use our own software for housing answers to employee questions—including a one-stop shop built on top of Zendesk Guide, our help center software, for all the employee resources available to support them through these times, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>wellbeing allowances</li>
<li>mental health resources</li>
<li>links to learning opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual humans on the Employee Shared Services team are still resources, but we want to give employees the ability to self-serve, especially on the kinds of questions that many employees tend to have about:</p>
<ul>
<li>time off</li>
<li>benefits</li>
<li>paycheck withholding</li>
</ul>
<p>One benefit of enabling our employees to self-serve is that all roles across our People &#038; Places organization are better able to evolve. The business partners can better focus on our leaders’ strategies, the needs of our teams, and the wellness of our global employees.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>How AI helps employees</h2>
<p>Answer Bot, Zendesk’s AI-enabled chat bot, uses machine learning to answer employee questions with content from our knowledge base. </p>
<ul>
<li>Currently Answer Bot solves 3 percent of all employee questions</li>
<li>Putting Answer Bot to work also helps us understand what content we are currently lacking—and thus what content we need to develop</li>
<li>In adding to the knowledge base, we further enrich our resources for employees</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>At home and at work</h2>
<p>Our strategy around digital first and virtual everyday will help us move our engagement with leaders and employees alike into a more creative and collaborative space. This evolution is critical for employee satisfaction. It’s also critical for the scale of our business and the needs of our customers.</p>
<p>Now people’s lives aren&#8217;t demarcated by home and by work, separately—they&#8217;re at home and at work. They&#8217;re in another country from each other, they&#8217;re in another time zone. If you don&#8217;t create this consistent employee experience, you&#8217;ve got chaos.  </p>
<p>But in pulling it off—and we are making that happen—we are setting the standard for a new way of working that keeps our employees and our customers top of mind.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The customer service requests your agents field have something valuable to tell you about your customers, product, and business. More than that, the cumulative data produced by your customer service tickets can reveal key insights.</p>
<p>But for your business to learn from the information included within all those requests, you need a good method for tracking and analyzing them.</p>
<p>Any business that cares about providing an exceptional customer experience will benefit from developing a system for creating and learning from customer service reports.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is a customer service report?</h2>
<p>A customer service report is a presentation of customer service metrics that helps you identify actionable insights related to the customer experience.</p>
<p>Customer service reports can include a number of different potential metrics that gauge the overall performance of your customer service team. They can be used to track how well you&rsquo;re meeting your goals, and help you identify areas for improvement.</p>
</div>
<h2>6 ways service reports contribute to customer satisfaction</h2>
<p>Customer service reports provide business intelligence that can help you improve the overall customer experience your company provides in several key ways.</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3>Reports help customer service managers track the quality of service that agents provide</h3>
<p>Customer service agents are on the frontlines of the customer experience. The company needs a way to track how well they&rsquo;re meeting customer expectations and providing the level of customer satisfaction your brand aims for.</p>
<p>Customer service metrics show customer support managers how well agents are performing on the whole, and how well specific agents are doing. They can then quickly identify when teams or individuals aren&rsquo;t meeting their goals, and determine the best way to address it and improve outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They can motivate customer support agents to improve</h3>
<p>Customer service reports provide customer service agents with a way to track their own progress. They can see how well they&rsquo;re meeting goals they&rsquo;ve set for themselves, and identify ways to improve their work performance.</p>
<p>For many agents, they function as a tool to incentivize them to meet customer needs better, as well as a way to show proven results that can help them in their career prospects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They help the company track the volume of customer service tickets</h3>
<p>You can have the best customer service representatives in the business, but if customers regularly face long hold times on the phone, or wait days for an email response, their expertise won&rsquo;t count for much. To keep customers happy and set your agents up for success, you need enough staff to respond to the number of inquiries coming in.</p>
<p>Customer service reporting helps you track how many tickets come in during a given period, and identify when you need to scale up your team to address them all effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They clarify which channels customers use to contact you</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just need the right number of customer service representatives on staff, you also need them covering the right channels.</p>
<p>If your call center agents spend most of the day waiting for calls to come in, while your social media team is consistently overwhelmed, customer satisfaction will suffer.</p>
<p>Customer support reporting provides insights into how many agents you need covering each channel and at which times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They reveal areas for product improvement</h3>
<p>If a huge number of customer support tickets are about a particular product feature not working as expected, the company needs to know about it.</p>
<p>Customer service reports can reveal important types of business intelligence. This can help the product development team create a better product, the marketing team develop better messaging, and your sales team ensure their pitch is accurate.</p>
<p>Customer support is often the first department to learn about it when customer expectations of a product aren&rsquo;t being met. Customer reports can reveal key business intelligence that&rsquo;s beneficial to the rest of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They help you identify content gaps</h3>
<p>A lot of the support your agents provide depends on the information they have access to in your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/using-smart-knowledge-base-unlock-agent-potential/">knowledge base</a>. They need content that helps them provide accurate answers to common customer issues.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
81% of customers prefer to try solving a problem on their own before contacting a customer support representative
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And 81% of customers express a preference for trying solving a problem on their own before contacting a customer support representative, according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service">Harvard Business Review</a>. Publishing content that solves common customer problems can create a better customer experience, while also reducing the number of tickets customer service agents must manage.</p>
<p>Customer service reports help with identifying opportunities for articles or video tutorials that explain how customers can solve common problems on their own. And if you realize agents are fielding questions that your internal support content doesn&rsquo;t adequately cover, you can determine what knowledge base articles or macros should be created to enable them to do their jobs better.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>6 common types of customer service reports</h2>
<p>Customer service reports are only useful if they include the right <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-kpis-need-track/">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a> to help you better understand the customer experience you&rsquo;re providing and meet your overall customer satisfaction goals.</p>
<p>These are some of the KPIs that are commonly useful to include in a business report.</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/first-reply-time/"><strong>First reply time</strong></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-research-customer-satisfaction/">Zendesk&rsquo;s research</a> shows a clear correlation between the time it takes for customers to receive an initial reply to a ticket, and their overall satisfaction. That makes this an important metric to track. Pay attention to the breakdown of how long it takes in different channels, for different agents, and for different issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Customer wait time</h3>
<p>Customer wait time, sometimes called requester wait time, is the combined amount of time a customer spends waiting on responses and answers in the time it takes to find a resolution to their issue.</p>
<p>Even if you knock the first reply time out of the park, if customers routinely spend long periods of time waiting on answers, their overall experience is likely to be negative. As with first reply time, note how this breaks down for different types of issues and for your different agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Time to full resolution</h3>
<p>Ultimately, one of the most important metrics for customer success is how long it takes you to fully resolve the issue at hand.</p>
<p>If agents manage to get answers out fast, but customers end up having to repeatedly come back because the problem isn&rsquo;t solved, prioritizing response speed could end up drawing the time it takes to find a real solution out longer.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> For time-related metrics like these, looking at the median is usually more valuable than the average. The median figures won&rsquo;t be skewed by outliers.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Interactions per ticket</h3>
<p>Every time a customer has to follow up on an open ticket, or provide additional information, they&rsquo;re having to do more work.</p>
<p>Agents should prioritize minimizing the number of touchpoints required to solve a customer&rsquo;s problem. To see how well they&rsquo;re pulling that off, track the typical number of interactions per ticket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT)</h3>
<p>Most customer service metrics measure something that <em>influences</em> <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/measure-customer-satisfaction/">customer satisfaction</a>. But CSAT scores are based on asking customers directly what they think. As such, they&rsquo;re typically among the most accurate measures available of how well your team is serving customers.</p>
<p>That said, looking at CSAT scores in isolation can still be misleading. CSAT can provide an overview of how your team is performing, but it&rsquo;s also valuable to look at how often people respond to CSAT surveys. An agent with a good CSAT average, but a low response rate, may not be wowing customers as much as the average makes it look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Number of incoming tickets</h3>
<p>This is less about gauging customer service performance, and more about helping customer service managers determine the staffing levels required to provide adequate customer service.</p>
<p>When you break this metric down, you&#8217;ll get more out of it. Knowing how many tickets or inquiries are coming in by channel tells you where you need to do the most hiring. And tracking which days and times of day are busiest helps you ensure you&rsquo;re scheduling agents at the right times.</p>
<p>Tracking the number of incoming tickets can also help you identify issues with the product. A big uptick in tickets within days of releasing a new product update tells you something&rsquo;s not working right, or the changes are unintuitive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to create and use customer service reports</h2>
<p>At some companies&mdash;particularly small or new businesses&mdash;creating customer service reports requires putting data about customer service interactions manually into a spreadsheet. This can make the process tedious, and make it harder to pull useful insights out of the data. And creating customer service reports is only useful if your company puts the information learned to good use.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s become more common, and works better for most companies, is investing in <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/explore/">customer service software</a> that automates the creation of customer service reports.</p>
<p>A good customer service reporting tool:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Removes most of the work from the process of collecting customer service metrics</li>
<li>Puts the data into a format that enables you to understand and use what you learn more effectively</li>
</ul>
<p>With easy access to up-to-date customer service reports, customer service managers can monitor service reports in real-time to look for trends that point to areas that need work, and to spot any changes that suggest the need for immediate action:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a sudden spike in live chat inquiries comes in, you want to notice right away so you can get more agents working that channel</li>
<li>If the metrics suggest agents are struggling to provide adequate answers, that points to a need to develop better content or provide enhanced training</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer support agents won&rsquo;t need access to service reports as often as managers. But for those who want to track their own progress, monthly reports can provide motivation and help them identify areas to improve.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3>A warning about customer service reports</h3>
<p>Monitoring customer service metrics doesn&rsquo;t automatically translate to knowing how to interpret them effectively. They&rsquo;ll point you toward <em>where</em> problems exist, but it&rsquo;s still up to people to diagnose the reason for the problem and the best solution to it. Building reports that don&rsquo;t actually provide useful information is easier than you may think. How you slice and dice numbers matters.</p>
<p>Make sure the metrics you prioritize match your stated goals or answer specific questions you have. And don&rsquo;t assume you know what the numbers mean without further exploration. Combine quantitative data with qualitative by examining individual tickets, talking to agents, or checking in with customers to fill in any gaps in the data.</p>
</div>
<h2>Use them well, and customer service reports are good for business</h2>
<p>So much of long-term business success depends on ensuring <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/measuring-customer-happiness/">customer happiness</a>. Customer service analytics can give you actionable information you can use to keep customers happy.</p>
<p>If your customer service metrics enable you to accurately identify areas in the business that need improvement, it can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher customer acquisition</li>
<li>Improved customer retention</li>
<li>Increased customer lifetime value</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The customer service industry is continually evolving. It seems like every day there&rsquo;s a new social media platform your agents need to adopt to stay relevant to your customers.</p>
<p>The good news is, one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/"><strong>People still prefer a phone call over any other customer support channel</strong></a>. (Yes, even millennials.)</p>
<p>If you want to win over your customers for life, you need to offer exceptional over-the-phone customer support. The trouble comes with trying to find a solution that improves agent efficiency <em>and</em> lowers business costs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where IVR technology can help.</p>
<h2>What is IVR, and how does it work?</h2>
<p>You know when you call a business and hear the automated menu, &ldquo;For billing, press 1; to hear business hours, press 2 . . .&rdquo;?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s IVR (interactive voice response). It works by collecting information from a customer (e.g., problem type or account number) and using it to route their call to the appropriate agent.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="How IVR works" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/how-ivr-works.png" /></p>
<p>IVR systems collect that information by prompting callers to select an option using their phone&rsquo;s touch-tone keypad. Some IVRs use advanced voice recognition technology, so callers can say their problem into the phone&rsquo;s speaker instead of selecting numbered options on their keypad.</p>
<p>IVRs can also <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024778213-Best-practices-for-rolling-out-Talk">direct callers to prerecorded answers</a>. Instead of waiting to talk to an agent, customers can get quick answers to common questions, like, &ldquo;What time do you open today?&rdquo; Customers can find the information they&rsquo;re looking for independently, and agents can dedicate their time to more complex issues.</p>
<p>With this functionality, IVR technology is a cost-effective solution for support teams. You&rsquo;re able to resolve more issues as a support team without needing to make additional hires.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Benefits of IVR" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/ivr-4-benefits.png" /></p>
<h2>4 customer support benefits of an IVR system</h2>
<p>Customers have increasingly high standards for support. In fact, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">65% expect customer service to be faster than it was five years ago</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where IVRs can be a game changer. They help customers resolve their issues quickly, without needing to be transferred between departments. IVRs can even provide 24/7 support for common issues, as well as prioritize callers based on their customer status.</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3>Faster resolution time</h3>
<p>During our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">2020 Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report</a>, we asked consumers, &ldquo;What is the most important aspect of a good customer service experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a resounding majority said, &ldquo;I can resolve my issue quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IVRs are like Siri or Alexa, but for your customers. They call in, tell the system what they want, and&mdash;voil&agrave;: they get the information they need quickly, from the best source (agent) available.</p>
<p>You can even use your IVR to set up prerecorded responses to FAQs, such as business hours, promotions, and directions. Customers can get answers to simple questions quickly without ever needing to speak to an agent.</p>
<p>IVRs don&rsquo;t just save time for customers, either. By deflecting and fielding simple questions, the technology allows agents to focus on solving more complex customer issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Higher first-contact resolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Sixty-eight percent of customers</a> say they get annoyed when their call is transferred between departments. Interactive voice response helps avoid the scenario altogether by ensuring that calls are routed to the right agent off the bat. This increases the overall speed and efficiency of a support team and helps improve <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-support-kpis-need-track/">first-contact resolution (FCR) rate.</a></p>

<blockquote><p>
      Sixty-eight percent of customers say they get annoyed when their call is transferred between departments
    </p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IVRs automatically route callers to the appropriate agent based on the customer&rsquo;s issue. Say, for example, a customer has questions about a recent invoice they received. All they have to do is press the right number on their keypad when prompted by the IVR (e.g., &ldquo;Press 1 for questions about your bill&rdquo;).</p>
<p>To maintain a high FCR rate, adjust your IVR system to fit customers&rsquo; changing needs. Maybe you&rsquo;ve released a new product, and customers are calling to learn more about it. With IVR, you can improve FCR by routing those callers to the agents who know the product best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>24/7 support</h3>
<p>Round-the-clock support is the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">second most important</a> aspect of a good customer service experience, second only to quick resolution. But not every business has the employee bandwidth to provide 24/7 service.</p>
<p>Remember those prerecorded responses to FAQs? Yep, that&rsquo;s your answer to 24/7 support.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: Last weekend, my internet went down. Unfortunately, I live in one of those towns that has only one local internet provider. And&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;they&rsquo;re closed on the weekends.</p>
<p>Annoyed and impatient, I called their customer service number anyway. And, right away, I was directed to a prerecorded message that explained exactly why the internet was out (a downed pole in my neighborhood). The message even gave a timeline for when they expected repairs to be complete.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s IVR provided me with real-time support, even outside of their normal working hours. And on their side, it probably took only about 30 seconds to record the message. With IVR, 24/7 is possible, no matter how big or small your company is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Call prioritization</h3>
<p>Two customers call your support number at the exact same time. Customer #1 pays for your lowest-tier subscription, valued at $20 a month. Customer #2 pays for your VIP package, valued at $250 a month. Which one would you help first?</p>
<p>Customer service agents need a system for prioritizing calls based on potential impact. After all, 58% of consumers <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">stop buying from a company after a single bad customer service interaction</a>. You simply can&rsquo;t afford to make high-value customers wait.</p>
<p>With an IVR system, you can assign priorities to specific phone numbers. That way, when a VIP customer calls support, they&rsquo;ll instantly be placed at the top of the queue and assigned to the most capable agent.</p>
<p>This level of support will leave your VIPs feeling valued and cared for. They&rsquo;ll be more likely to buy from you again, as well as recommend you to friends and family. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll be able to increase retention and referrals rates&mdash;at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Press &ldquo;1&rdquo; for exceptional customer support</h2>
<p>Our phones aren&rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon. To provide the level of support your customers expect, offer quick, personalized, 24/7 support over the phone.</p>
<p>An easy and cost-effective way to do that is with an IVR system. And with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/">Zendesk Talk</a>, it takes only a few minutes to set up. Get started with a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/ivr-software/">free trial</a> today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people will interact with a customer service representative at some point in their life, and yet, we don&#8217;t take the time to appreciate the patience and skills required to be a support agent. </p>
<p>We think these customer service gifs sum it up nicely:</p>
<h2>1. When you sit down at your desk and realize how many tickets are in your queue</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Person sitting at their desk holding a cup of coffee and staring blankly" data-src="https://zen-marketing-content.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cust-serv-gif-sweating.gif" /><br />

<h2>3. When a teammate compliments your outfit</h2>

" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Troubleshooting a simple problem like:</h2>

<h2>5. When a customer hangs up on you</h2>

&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Show a customer service agent some love</h2>
<p>Jokes aside, the reality is that support agents have a tough job. They have to balance multiple competing priorities, be the experts of their product or service, and stay in control of their emotions when customers complain. That&#8217;s a lot of pressure, and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/call-center-burnout/">agent burnout</a> is surprisingly common. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important we give them credit where credit is due. The next time you contact customer support, remember that there&#8217;s a hardworking human on the other side. </p>
<p>Here are a few ways to show your appreciation:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Say thank you</li>
<li><a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/connect-silent-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Submit feedback</a> on surveys</li>
<li>Write a review of a product you love</li>
<li>Shout out great customer service on social media</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the stories of companies going above and beyond to provide their customers with incredible support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morton&rsquo;s steakhouse met a man at the airport with a steak because he asked for one in a tweet</li>
<li>Nordstrom&rsquo;s accepted a set of returned tires even though Nordstrom doesn&#8217;t actually sell tires</li>
<li>Sainsbury renamed one of its products &ldquo;giraffe bread&rdquo; after a 3-year-old made the suggestion</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these stories are heart-warming. Some are inspiring. And some garnered good PR and attention on social media.</p>
<p>One thing they all have in common, though: <strong>None of them is scalable</strong>.</p>
<p>No restaurant could afford to deliver an airport steak to its entire customer base. And while giraffe bread hit the mark, it wouldn&#8217;t be advisable for companies to take every branding suggestion. There are many <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/the-5-biggest-crowdsourcing-fails-of-all-time-.html">cautionary tales</a> to illustrate that last point.</p>
<p>Beyond the issue of scalability, most companies couldn&rsquo;t afford to copy these actions, either, no matter how much they stick in our minds.</p>
<p>Customer obsession must go beyond such outlier examples. Instead, it needs to come from a company&rsquo;s commitment to provide great experiences every day.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is customer obsession?</h2>
<p>Customer obsession is a state of hyperfocus on creating a better customer experience from the customer&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a commitment to having a customer-first approach. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer needs are at the center of everything you do</li>
<li>The customer experience, everything from sales to marketing to support, is built around these needs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Examples of businesses successfully implementing a customer-obsessed strategy</h2>
<p>While the above examples certainly paint a picture of customer obsession, it would be difficult for a company of any size to replicate them on a consistent basis. But any company, no matter the size, location, or industry can be customer obsessed.</p>
<h3>1. Disney walks the walk</h3>
<p>There are many examples of Disney going above and beyond to create world-class customer experiences. You can see it in everything they do, from treating all guests to their parks as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/disneyinstitute/2018/04/24/how-disney-uses-spontaneity-to-make-customers-feel-like-true-vips/#60179b184f64">VIPs (Very Individual Person)</a> to masterful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hbr.org/sponsored/2018/02/how-disney-empowers-its-employees-to-deliver-exceptional-customer-service">training</a> of their staff.</p>
<p>But before any of that could happen, leadership at Disney first had to make the extremely important decision (though they probably didn&rsquo;t use these words) to be a customer obsessed company.</p>
<p>The decision to do so came straight from Walt Disney himself. One anecdote, as relayed in our podcast episode <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/disney-reimagined-cruise-experience/">How Disney reimagined the cruise experience</a>, perfectly encapsulates this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;Another kind of cool little point is he (Walt Disney) wanted to keep his park clean. So, he hired people to stand there and see how many steps a person would take before throwing their trash on the ground and not getting to a trash can, let&#8217;s say. And that answer was 30 feet. So if you go to any Disney park, there&#8217;s a trash can every 30 feet.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>-Arnold Tijerina, marketing consultant and Disney Institute graduate</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Walk a mile in your customers&rsquo; shoes (or at least 30 feet) to learn what needs to be improved.</p>
</div>
<h3>2. Franklin Synergy Bank treats customers like trusted partners</h3>
<p>Nate Brown, cofounder of CX Accelerator and owner of the appropriately titled Twitter handle <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/customerisfirst">@customerfirst,</a> told us of an incredible experience he had with a financial institution:</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;At no point have we wondered where in the process we were or if this life-changing transaction was in good hands. Talk about building trust and creating ambassadors for your brand!&rdquo;<br />
<cite>Nate Brown</cite>
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>&ldquo;Franklin Synergy Bank is another wonderful example of CX innovation in an industry that desperately needs it. Both my sister and my friend Becky had terrible experiences securing their financing, so we were pretty nervous. The Franklin team has been remarkable since day one. They displayed tremendous patience and integrity with us while we worked through the initial steps. As we&#8217;ve moved forward in the process, they&#8217;ve communicated via educational videos, courtesy calls, and an online portal. At no point have we wondered where in the process we were or if this life-changing transaction was in good hands. Talk about building trust and creating ambassadors for your brand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Respect, regular communication, and using the tools at your disposal (videos, support calls, portals) to help educate your customers can go a long way.</p>
</div>
<h3>3. Birchbox goes deep on customer data</h3>
<p>Birchbox is a subscription service that sends its customers makeup samples and other beauty products, for men and women. According to Leanna Nazzisi, customer operations at Birchbox,</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &ldquo;As one of the world&rsquo;s largest grooming and beauty subscription services, Birchbox is obsessed with delighting our customers with personalized, white-glove experiences. And one of the most powerful tools in our toolbox for delivering world-class experiences is exceptional customer service and support.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>Leanna Nazzisi, customer operations at Birchbox</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Leanna and her crew achieve this by going deep on <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/10-customer-experience-kpis/">customer experience KPIs</a>. They monitor the customer experience as well as agent performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are requests for support spiking, causing a backlog in tickets?</li>
<li>Are individual agents improving over time?</li>
<li>Are customers happy with the items they&rsquo;re receiving?</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to answer these questions without having access to data, and with the right tools,<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/birchbox-gives-customers-time-personalized-customer-support/"> Birchbox</a> is able to not only collect but also analyze and act on that data.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Customer obsession requires an obsession with data. You&rsquo;ve probably heard it a million times, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating: You can&rsquo;t improve if you don&rsquo;t measure.</p>
</div>
<h2>Priorities of a customer-obsessed business</h2>
<p>There are two, and while the first one is obvious, the second one might be a surprise to some people.</p>
<h3>Customer engagement</h3>
<p>A customer-obsessed company will be fanatical about <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-engagement-actually-means/">customer engagement</a>. Above all else, this is about understanding customers and providing value for them. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting feedback and actively listening to it</li>
<li>Having extreme customer focus</li>
<li>Injecting empathy into every interaction at every touchpoint</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employee engagement</h3>
<p>This should come as no surprise. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/employee-experience-consumer-expectations-shaping-workplace/">Employee engagement</a>, and a company culture that encourages it, is almost as high a priority to the customer-obsessed organization as customer engagement is.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better performance.</strong> An engaged employee will take the extra time needed to thoroughly solve customer problems. Unengaged employees can sometimes go on autopilot and not really think about what the customer needs.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced turnover.</strong> An employee who feels engaged with their company will be more likely to continue working there, building up their institutional knowledge, and refining their skills over time. Veteran employees are invaluable for creating great customer experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want engaged employees? You&rsquo;ll need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent training</li>
<li>Management, coaching, and mentoring</li>
<li>Opportunities for career development</li>
<li>Recognition of a job well done</li>
<li>Compassionate QA teams</li>
<li>Opportunities to participate in change management efforts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Qualities of customer obsession</h2>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>Understand your customers and experience things from their point of view</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/">CX Trends report</a> revealed that friendly support reps and quick service are top contributors to customer satisfaction. Both are big signs that a company respects its customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Put in the work to create effortless experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Open and honest communication can go a long way toward a customer&rsquo;s perception of how any individual interaction went. If two customers are made to wait, but only one gets regular updates, you can probably guess which one will be likely to return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Customer-centricity</h3>
<p>True customer obsession isn&rsquo;t limited to the customer service department. All departments have to understand that they are all a part of building the customer experience. For example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/11/20/15-marketing-strategy-tips-to-improve-your-customer-experience/#26f9053c3069">customer-centric marketing.</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Steps to create a more customer-obsessed culture</h2>
<p>Here are things you can start doing today:</p>
<h3>Inspire the whole company with strong leadership principles</h3>
<p>The above anecdote about Disney is a perfect example of how important it is to take a top-down approach to prioritizing customers. Remember, Walt Disney himself walked the grounds of his own amusement park to not only identify the problem but also develop a solution.</p>
<p>Many if not all companies that provide great experiences are led by people who push their employees to put the customer first.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles">Amazon</a>, which is widely credited with popularizing the term &ldquo;customer obsession,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer loyalty. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Build the right team</h3>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working out of a garage or an enterprise with tens of thousands of employees, nobody can do it alone. It is crucial that you build a team that understands and buys into your mission.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-customer-service-representative/"><strong>Hiring.</strong></a> Learn how to find and hire talented people who will help you achieve your goals and will always put take care of customer needs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/agent-life-cycle-guide/"><strong>Onboarding.</strong></a> To be customer obsessed, even the most experienced support professionals need to internalize the specifics of your company. Proper onboarding is crucial.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-management/"><strong>Managing.</strong></a> Customer service is a marathon, not a sprint. Plus, customer expectations shift, support tools improve, and the world never stops changing, so proper management is key.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Innovate and iterate</h3>
<p>Of course, you can be the best manager in the world with the greatest team ever assembled and still let things get stale. It isn&rsquo;t possible to put customers at the center of everything you do if you don&rsquo;t pay attention to them. That means measuring and acting on the data (see the Birchbox example above), encouraging customer feedback, and making a commitment to never stop improving.</p>
<h2>Why customer obsession is important</h2>
<p>Lastly, and for those who might think the above is a little pie-in-the-sky, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the benefits customer obsession can have on your company. As I wrote earlier, customer obsession is a focus on all aspects of the customer experience, right down to each customer interaction. As you&rsquo;ll see, an individual interaction could mean all the difference between a loyal customer and someone who will take their business elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Customer retention</h3>
<p>Customer <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/business-impact-customer-service/">loyalty</a> is everything, so it&#8217;s paramount that you focus on keeping existing customers happy.</p>
<p>According to our research into <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/business-impact-customer-service/">customer lifetime value</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>54 percent of respondents said they have purchased more products/used more service from a company based off of a single, positive interaction with that company</li>
<li>58 percent said they stopped doing business with a company after a single negative one. And 46 percent of those people said they stopped doing business with that company for up to two years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer acquisition</h3>
<p>According to the same study:</p>
<ul>
<li>67 percent of respondents said they were likely to recommend a company&#8217;s products or services to others based on a single interaction</li>
<li>52 percent said they&rsquo;d warn off others based on a single negative interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Word of mouth is crucial for any business, and you&rsquo;re helping spread the word &#8212; whether you know it or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone tells you they spent hours on the phone with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-skills/">customer service</a>, it&rsquo;s usually a horror story. We all know the tropes of the genre&mdash;torturously long waits, endless transfers, inescapable hold music&#8230;</p>
<p>But at Zendesk, some of our support agents take pride in their longest customer calls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one advocate who boasted that they spent two hours talking about Star Wars with an admin,&rdquo; says <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-vandewalle-gore-2a56a38/">Holly Vande Walle</a>, Director of Training and Quality Assurance at Zendesk Global Customer Advocacy. &ldquo;That admin is now a promoter for life because they had such a great experience with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your agents don&rsquo;t necessarily need to have strong opinions about whether or not <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/13/20963415/disney-plus-star-wars-han-shot-first-greedo-edit">Han shot first</a>&mdash;after all, some of them may be Trekkies. But they <em>do</em> need to have a willingness to engage customers in real conversation, as opposed to an incentive to rush through calls as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about customer courtesy, you and your support team should offer more than table stakes customer service. Instead of the bare minimum, build a culture of going above and beyond for customers to keep them happy.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is the definition of customer courtesy?</h2>
<p><strong>Customer courtesy</strong> refers to all of the words and actions that customer service reps use to show their customers recognition and respect.</p>
<p>Nailing customer courtesy isn&rsquo;t about perfecting any one thing, but a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/right-tone-of-voice/">Tone of voice</a>, word choice, helpfulness, enthusiasm, respect&mdash;they&rsquo;re all part of it.</p>
</div>
<p>Being friendly is easy when you&rsquo;re talking to a friendly customer. It&rsquo;s harder to keep that bubbly energy up when the person on the other end of the line is annoyed, angry, or aggressive. But that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s needed most: If a customer is frustrated from the start, it takes a lot of extra soothing to win them over.</p>
<p>The challenge of customer courtesy is constantly reminding yourself that the customer is always right&mdash;even when they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<h2>8 customer courtesy tips for support reps</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Connect customers quickly" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/connect-customers-agents-quickly.png" /></p>
<h3>1. Connect customers with agents ASAP</h3>
<p>Have you ever called a business and gotten stuck on an automated phone menu? You&rsquo;re just trying to connect with a human being, but the pre-recorded menu keeps directing you to more recordings.</p>
<p>Phone trees are good for handling massive volumes, but you don&rsquo;t want customers listening to a recording forever. <strong>Set up your menu to connect customers with agents as quickly as possible</strong>. If staffing is the issue, see if you can have more reps on deck at peak hours.</p>
<p>A key component of courtesy is respecting a customer&rsquo;s time. If you can&rsquo;t handle a ticket right away, politely provide them with a reasonable timeline. Tell <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/10-best-call-center-etiquette-tips-support-agents/">people on the phone</a> how long they&rsquo;ll have to hold, and respond to support emails and messages with a commitment to follow up within a certain time frame.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Start on a friendly note" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/start-friendly-note.png" /></p>
<h3>2. Start on a friendly note</h3>
<p>You only get one chance to make a first impression. Give a cheerful &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good afternoon&rdquo; before introducing yourself to the caller. Use similar courtesy phrases in written communication channels&mdash;&ldquo;I hope this email finds you well&rdquo; or &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your day going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unless the customer seems like they&rsquo;re in a hurry, <strong>don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask how they&rsquo;re doing and engage in a little small talk</strong>. Instead of following <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/dont-always-need-call-center-scripts/">call scripts</a> to the letter, use them more as guidelines for fostering casual, natural conversations.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Don’t hide behind we" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/dont-hide-behind-we.png" /></p>
<h3>3. Don&rsquo;t hide behind &ldquo;we&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Use the pronouns &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; when talking to a customer. It sounds a lot more personal than saying &ldquo;we&rdquo; to refer to your whole company.</p>
<p>Not to mention, &ldquo;we&rdquo; can turn into a crutch for deflecting blame. <strong>Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry&rdquo; when a customer shares a complaint&mdash;say, &ldquo;</strong><em><strong>I&rsquo;m</strong></em> <strong>sorry.&rdquo;</strong> People appreciate accountability (even if it&rsquo;s not <em>really </em>your fault).</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Verbal nods" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/give-verbal-nods.png" /></p>
<h3>4. Give &ldquo;verbal nods&rdquo; when the customer is talking</h3>
<p>Since you can&rsquo;t make eye contact over the phone, do the next best thing: Remember to &ldquo;verbally nod&rdquo; when a customer is explaining an issue. The occasional <strong>&ldquo;yeah,&rdquo; &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; or &ldquo;uh-huh&rdquo;</strong> lets people know that you&rsquo;re actively listening to them.</p>
<p>In live chat, a simple <strong>&ldquo;got it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I see&rdquo;</strong> serves the same purpose, ensuring customers that you&rsquo;re following along.</p>
<p>Try to refrain from interjecting with a long-winded response, even if you think you know the solution right away. Wait until the caller has clearly finished talking to respond in full.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Show compassion" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/show-compassion.png" /></p>
<h3>5. Show compassion</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get bored when a customer tells you about issues that you handle all the time. But to them, the problem <em>is </em>important.</p>
<p>Step into their frame of mind and let them know you understand the seriousness of the problem. Validate customers&rsquo; complaints with phrases like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right.&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;So sorry you had to deal with that.&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Thank you so much for highlighting this issue; I&rsquo;ll work to get it resolved right away.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how angry a customer is. You need to show every caller empathy to build their trust in your brand and service.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Ask for confirmation" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/ask-for-confirmation.png" /></p>
<h3>6. Always ask for confirmation</h3>
<p>Customers hate having to repeat themselves. Keep the conversation smooth by checking in with them to make sure you understand their problem.</p>
<p>After they&rsquo;ve explained their problem, tell them, &ldquo;I just want to be absolutely sure that I fully understand what I&rsquo;m hearing&mdash;you&rsquo;re saying . . . &rdquo; At that point, describe their problem back to them. Invite them to correct you if you&rsquo;ve mischaracterized what they said.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="On the case" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/on-the-case.png" /></p>
<h3>7. Let them know you&rsquo;re on the case</h3>
<p>Customers appreciate a speedy resolution to their issue. Match their sense of urgency with <strong>reassuring courtesy phrases like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get on that right away.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>When solving a problem for someone over the phone, <strong>don&rsquo;t allow too much dead air</strong> to pass while you&rsquo;re working. Explain what you&rsquo;re doing while you&rsquo;re doing it. For example, you might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m currently pulling up your account details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keep customers in the loop about each step you&rsquo;re taking. Even if the issue is challenging, they&rsquo;ll feel more confident that you can solve the problem if you share your approach.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="End on a high note" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/end-high-note.png" /></p>
<h3>8. End on a high note</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to seem like you&rsquo;re in a hurry to get off the line. Always ask, &ldquo;Is there anything else I can help you with?&rdquo; before ending the conversation.</p>
<p>If everything&rsquo;s been resolved to their satisfaction, end on a cheerful note. <strong>Consider closing by showing your gratitude and saying, &ldquo;Thanks so much for your patience today!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2>Why is courtesy important in customer service?</h2>
<p>Plain and simple, a lack of customer courtesy can wreak havoc on your retention rates.</p>
<p>A 2018 <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value/">Zendesk study</a> found that:</p>
<ul class="bordered">
<li>58% of consumers who had bad customer service experiences with a company <strong>stopped buying from them</strong>, and 52% <strong>switched to a competitor</strong></li>
<li>48% of customers said they were <strong>unlikely to consider that company</strong> when making future purchases</li>
<li>Over 50% of consumers said they <strong>told their friends, family, coworkers, and other contacts</strong> about bad service experiences (up from 40% in 2013)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the damage done from negative interactions goes far beyond one lost customer. Consumers have become more likely to share how they feel about poor support experiences. And with the Internet, they have a massive platform to air their grievances.</p>
<p>At the same time, more customers are also sharing stories of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/good-customer-service-defined/"><em>good</em> customer service</a> interactions. In 2018, a full <strong>two-thirds of customers said they recommended products or services after a positive service interaction</strong>. Five years prior, just half of customers were spreading the good news.</p>
<p>Providing courteous customer service can also change buyer behavior for the better. Over half of all customers who had good service experiences said they purchased or used more products and services from the same company.</p>
<p>Subpar support can cost you a customer, and possibly everyone else they tell about their awful experience. But notable examples of customer courtesy can increase a customer&rsquo;s loyalty, make them likely to buy more, and inspire them to brag to others about your company.</p>
<h2>Commit to uncommonly courteous customer service</h2>
<p>A little common courtesy goes a long way, and a little uncommon courtesy can go even farther. Whether it&rsquo;s a surprisingly long and friendly customer conversation or a shockingly fast and thorough resolution, a great customer service interaction stands out. Customers notice when you go the extra mile&mdash;and they often tell others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any type of career a person chooses will require developing a relevant skill set.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s largely a matter of gaining a pertinent body of knowledge&mdash;doctors need to learn as much about the health and medical fields as possible, for instance.</p>
<p>People who choose to work in customer-facing roles have to learn a set of skills that are as much about honing personality traits as learning facts.</p>
<p>Working with customers can be immensely rewarding for people who enjoy helping others. But anyone considering a career that involves interacting with clients or customers directly will need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>What customer-facing jobs entail</li>
<li>How to develop the proper skills to do them well</li>
</ul>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is a customer-facing role?</h2>
<p>A customer-facing role is any role or job function that involves direct interactions with customers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true across channels. Any employee likely to&mldr;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a face-to-face conversation with a customer</li>
<li>Exchange emails with them</li>
<li>Reply to their social media posts</li>
<li>Talk with them on the phone</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; is in a customer-facing role.</p>
</div>
<p>Customer-facing roles also include employees that work with customers at different touchpoints in the customer journey, from when they&rsquo;re still thinking about buying from you, to years into being a customer of your brand.</p>
<p>In practice customer-facing roles can take a lot of forms, and the particulars of what different ones look like can vary significantly. But they&rsquo;re all crucial to a company&rsquo;s brand image and overall success.</p>
<h2>Types of customer-facing roles</h2>
<p>What counts as a customer-facing role at your company will depend on the type of business you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>In the hospitality industry, it includes waiters, bartenders, porters, concierges and counter attendants. In the retail industry, clerks and salespeople fit the category. Field service technicians, jobs in IT support, and any administrative personnel that take calls and set up appointments are also customer-facing employees.</p>
<p>Most customer-facing roles involve interacting with external customers&mdash;the people paying for a company&rsquo;s products or services. However, in some cases, customer-facing roles can include those who deal with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/internal-customer-service/"><ins>internal customers</ins></a>. Using this definition, human resources professionals are also in customer-facing roles.</p>
<p>This is a broad category that contains a lot of different job titles. But the most obvious type of customer-facing roles are those that fall under the customer service umbrella. This includes (but isn&rsquo;t limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer service agent</li>
<li>Customer service specialist</li>
<li>Customer support representative</li>
<li>Customer success manager</li>
<li>Customer support engineer</li>
<li>Customer care operator</li>
<li>Client services coordinator</li>
<li>Customer liaison officer</li>
<li>Customer relationship specialist</li>
<li>Call center agent</li>
<li>Receptionist</li>
<li>Account executive</li>
<li>Cashier</li>
<li>Member services specialist</li>
<li>Technical support representative</li>
<li>Social media customer care</li>
</ul>
<p>The details of these job roles may vary, but they all center around the need to serve customers and ensure their experience with the brand is a good one.</p>
<h2>What makes someone good at customer-facing roles?</h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re in a position to hire customer service representatives. Or perhaps you want to pursue a career in a customer-facing job yourself. Either way, it&rsquo;s a good idea to understand what it takes to succeed in these roles.</p>
<h3>Key skills</h3>
<p>Many of the same skills and abilities that make someone good at <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-skills/"><ins>customer service</ins></a> apply to a broader range of positions.</p>
<p>Success in customer-facing roles requires being good at:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>Communication is essential in any customer-facing role. That includes both written communication across channels from <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/skill-every-chat-agent-needs-to-have/"><ins>live chat </ins></a>to email to social media, as well as verbal communication, whether <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://relate.zendesk.com/education/support-customers-phone/"><ins>over the phone</ins></a> or in person.</p>
<p>Depending on the role, you may need to be particularly good at one form of communication. (Call center agents, for example, must excel at verbal communication.) But as much as possible, anyone that wants to work in a customer-facing role will benefit from developing both their written and oral communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research skills</strong></p>
<p>The best customer-facing employees are curious and willing to do the work to learn all the skills they need. This may mean digging into learning all about a new industry when hired in a role, or doing extensive research to understand a specific problem a customer has.</p>
<p>Knowing how to do research effectively is a useful skill for anyone in a customer-facing role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem-solving</strong></p>
<p>Most of a customer service agent&rsquo;s job is solving problems. Not only must you be willing to commit time and research to diagnosing problems, you then have to figure out the best solution to them. People who relish this challenge are more likely to thrive in customer-facing roles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personality traits</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one type of person who&rsquo;s perfect for every single customer-facing role. However, people who do the best in these roles often share <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/5-traits-perfect-customer-service-employee/"><ins>personality traits</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few that are particularly important:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Patience</strong></p>
<p>Customer-facing employees frequently have to exhibit patience to do their job well.</p>
<p>In a given week, they&rsquo;ll face the screeds of angry customers, not to mention complex problems that defy quick-and-easy solutions. They&rsquo;ll put up with harsh words and frustrating problems that make their job harder. Patience is crucial in those moments, and it comes more naturally to some people than it does to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/empathy-chaotic-world-new-way-say-thanks/"><ins>Empathy</ins></a> is the ability to understand and share in the feelings of someone else. Truly understanding what a customer is going through and the feelings involved in their experience makes helping them effectively much easier. Customer-facing employees with a well-developed sense of empathy will do this best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Humblidence</strong></p>
<p>This term may be new to you. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s one of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/about/"><ins>Zendesk&rsquo;s core values</ins></a>, coined internally. It means finding just the right combination of being humble and confident.</p>
<p>To be amazing in a customer-facing role, you need the confidence to trust you can help people, but the humility to know their needs aren&rsquo;t about you. Find that balance, and you&rsquo;ll serve customers well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5 ways to hone your customer-facing talents</h2>
<p>A lot of the skills and traits above don&rsquo;t come naturally to everyone. So if you want to work in a customer-facing role, how do you put yourself in a position to excel?</p>
<p>While you may be able to find customer service training books or courses that promise to provide all you need, the best way to improve your customer skills is to take a more active approach to learning.</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Look for opportunities to help people</h4>
<p>One of the best forms of customer experience training is simply finding ways to help people.</p>
<p>That could mean seeking out volunteer roles in your community that involve interfacing with people. Or it could mean noticing when a friend is struggling with obligations they&rsquo;re balancing and offering a hand.</p>
<p>Every time you provide help to someone in a hands-on way&mdash;friend or stranger&mdash;you&rsquo;re beefing up your problem-solving skills. That&rsquo;s better customer service training than a course is likely to offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Read novels</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/"><ins>Researchers have found evidence</ins></a> that reading novels helps improve a person&rsquo;s capacity for empathy.</p>
<p>Getting inside the heads of fictional characters and thinking and feeling what they do is a great way to exercise your empathy muscles. For anyone that wants to improve their customer interaction skills, head to the library and grab some fiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Learn the industry</h4>
<p>In order to effectively help customers, you need to know what you&rsquo;re talking about. If you provide IT support, that means learning as much as you can about the technical issues likely to affect your customers. If you&rsquo;re a hotel concierge, it means learning all about your local area.</p>
<p>The specifics of this step will depend on the kind of business you work in. But taking time to learn about the topics your customers care about and need help with is an important step for every customer-facing employee to take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Take on DIY (do-it-yourself) projects</h4>
<p>When something breaks in your house, see if you can figure out what caused the problem and fix it yourself. Or if you have an old piece of tech no one depends on, try taking it apart and putting it back together again.</p>
<p>The ability to diagnose and solve problems is a big part of providing customer satisfaction. Practicing those skills in your day-to-day life can make you better at doing the same for customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Pay attention to your own customer experiences</h4>
<p>Getting inside the head of a customer is easy if you remember that you&rsquo;re <em>also</em> one. Every person in a customer-facing role at their job is in the customer role at many other times.</p>
<p>When you call customer support for a product you use or listen to a salesperson make a pitch, pay attention to how their actions make you feel. What do they do that makes your experience good? And if your experience is bad, what caused that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>A winning customer strategy depends on customer-facing roles</h2>
<p>Every interaction a person has with a company plays a role in how they perceive the brand. Each time they have an experience with someone in a customer-facing role, they view them as a representative of the company.</p>
<p>That can be good or bad, depending on how well the people in those jobs handle their responsibilities. Even just one bad interaction can have a serious effect, with half of customers in the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/"><ins>Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report,</ins></a> saying that&rsquo;s enough to switch brands. Make it two bad encounters, and <strong>80% of customers</strong> are ready to ditch a brand for a competitor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when customer-facing employees nail it and help create an amazing <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-companies-should-invest-in-the-customer-experience/"><ins>customer experience</ins></a>, it breeds customer loyalty. And <strong>52% of customers</strong> in the trends report said they <em>go out of their way</em> to stick with brands they feel loyal to.</p>
<p>Customer-facing employees have the power to make or break the customer experience and shape a brand&rsquo;s reputation. Making sure the people who work in these roles at a company have the skills to wow customers is imperative.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High performing customer experience teams are more than twice as likely as underperforming teams to be taking an omnichannel approach, according to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Zendesk’s Customer Experience Trends Report</a>, 2020. </p>
<p>Yet Zendesk findings also revealed that only 35 percent of Benchmark companies have an omnichannel strategy in place. This gap represents a sweet spot where businesses can rise above their competition and differentiate on the basis of customer experience. </p>
<p>Success starts with understanding how omnichannel differs from multichannel—and why that matters. It also requires a business to determine how an omnichannel strategy can create a better experience for its customers, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/staffing-omnichannel-strategy/">agents</a>, and other teams across the organization. </p>
<h2>What is omnichannel?</h2>
<p><b>Omnichannel—sometimes spelled omni-channel—is a customer experience strategy that creates connected and consistent customer interactions across channels.</b></p>
<p>When businesses take an omnichannel approach to the customer experience, they end siloed conversations by consolidating channels and customer context coming from those channels under a single source of truth. This enables teams to reference the customer information they need, when they need it—regardless of channel. </p>
<h2>What is the difference between multichannel and omnichannel?</h2>
<p>Plenty of companies today boast about providing &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; experiences but what they usually mean is simply “multi-channel.”</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<ul>
<li>Multi-channel means being everywhere your customers are. That’s table stakes.</li>
<li>Omnichannel means going a step further and providing a consistent communications journey for your customer, one where the conversation history and context travels with them from channel to channel.</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>Context — about who your customer is, where they’re coming from and what they’ve talked to you about in the past — is crucial for delivering the sort of messaging experiences <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/cx-customer-service-ai-zendesk-kustomer-powerfront">customers have grown accustomed to</a> in their personal lives.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload "src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/j/smooch/omnichannel/ChannelTransfer-Diagram.jpg" alt="Omnichannel and multichannel are different. Omnichannel is better." /></p>
<p>But <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/context-leads-better-chatbots-better-conversation/">context is frustratingly tricky to maintain</a> in a world of countless disconnected communication channels, from chat apps like Facebook Messenger, Line and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/expanding-omnichannel-support-whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, to email, SMS, mobile and web chat, not to mention the growing legion of voice assistants.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting for businesses to view the proliferation of channels as an inconvenience, the truth is, not all channels are created equal. In real life, a crowded bar might be a good place to start a conversation but it&#8217;s nice to be able to move somewhere quieter for more privacy.</p>
<p>In other words, every conversation has its proper place. </p>
<blockquote><p>True omnichannel means giving businesses the ability to talk to the right customers, in the right place, without sacrificing context along the way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Keep context at the center of every conversation</h3>
<p>Back in 2016, we introduced the ability for end-users to move conversations from <a href="https://smooch.io/embeddable-chat-sdks/">Sunshine Conversation’s Web Messenger</a> to a more mobile-friendly channel like Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber, Telegram or SMS with the click of a button.</p>
<p>Today <em>businesses</em> have the tools to invite users to move a conversation to a channel that is better suited to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>By posting a link or call to action into the conversation, businesses can invite customers to join them on a more secure channel, a cheaper channel, one with a richer experience or one that’s simply more convenient for the user.</p>
<p>This new set of APIs allows businesses to easily transfer the conversation from a chat app to in-app or web chat, from an email to SMS — or any other combination that makes sense. In fact, businesses can provide customers with a set of choices for where they&#8217;d like to continue the conversation or get notified of a reply later on.</p>
<div id="in-content-banner" class="js-in-content-banner in-content-banner banner-green">
<div class="js-in-content-header in-content-header">Want to learn more about omnichannel customer experience?</div>
<div class="in-content-cta-container">
<a class="golion-gen-btn js-in-content-cta in-content-cta" href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/omnichannel-support-with-zendesk/">Yes please</a>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the conversation moves, the chat history and context moves with it, so both the business and its users benefit from a single, continuous, cross-channel conversation thread. Meanwhile, the user’s identity is unified in the business’ software, allowing brands to provide a truly omnichannel and personalized experience.</p>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h2>Advantages of an omnichannel strategy</h2>
<p>When companies know who they’re talking to and what information that customer (or prospect) has already shared with them, they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolve issues faster</li>
<li>Deliver more personalized experiences</li>
<li>Better identify opportunities to satisfy customers</li>
<li>Reduce churn or increase revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a better experience for everyone.
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<h2>When does a business need an omnichannel strategy?</h2>
<p>It’s not difficult to imagine why customers and businesses would be interested in having seamless conversations across channels, but it’s perhaps less obvious why they would proactively move a conversation from, say, Facebook Messenger to their own mobile app, or from their website to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Here are a few scenarios where changing channels might come in handy:</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h3>When businesses want to authenticate customers to perform sensitive operations</h3>
<p>Consumer chat apps like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are great because they’re so accessible, but sometimes brands need to have private conversations with their customers.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/pronavigator-insurance-chatbots/">bank or insurance company</a> and need to authenticate your user before exchanging sensitive information. Using a call to action, you can prompt the customer to sign in to your own mobile app and continue the conversation there.
</p>
<p><img class="lazyload "src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/j/smooch/omnichannel/MOBILE-1.jpg" alt="" />
          </li>
<li>
<h3>When a user wants to be notified that the business has replied to their message on a more convenient channel</h3>
<p>Let’s say someone is browsing your business’ website and pings you with a question via your custom web messenger. Maybe your agent isn’t able to answer right away or maybe the user has a little back-and-forth with a bot, but has to run before the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Rather than hang around your website, the customer would probably prefer to receive a notification via Messenger (or email or SMS) when you’ve replied to their message.</p>
<p>Most web messengers prompt users to enter their email address, but in the modern messaging age it’s nice to give customers more options. And if the customer is available to keep chatting, they can do so on the new channel without skipping a beat.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload "src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/j/smooch/omnichannel/notifications.jpg" alt="" />
          </li>
<li>
<h3>When businesses want to move the conversation to a channel that costs less or to provide a better user experience</h3>
<p>Being wherever your customers are is important, but that doesn’t mean channels are interchangeable. Chat apps offer <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/apple-business-chat-and-google-business-messages/">richer user experiences</a> than SMS and they’re also free (depending on the country, SMS costs can really add up for businesses and consumers alike).</p>
<p>Email conversations may beat phone calls by a longshot but they don’t hold a candle to the rich messaging experiences users have come to know and love. And in some cases, the secure, branded environment of a business’ mobile app or web chat may be the best place for a conversation to flourish.</p>
<p>No matter the case, Sunshine Conversations lets you move a conversation from email, to web messenger, to messaging app to SMS with the click of a button. You never lose track of who the customer is, where they came from and why they came to you in the first place. Because that context is precious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>When a business doesn’t want third-party platforms eavesdropping on the conversation</h3>
<p>Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Twitter — these channels are great for discovery, but they’re still Facebook’s Messenger, Tencent’s WeChat and Twitter’s Twitter. Many businesses aren’t keen on sharing conversations with the Big Tech companies for them to mine and monetize.</p>
<p>Now you can engage customers on a popular platform and then get down to business on a more private one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of a good omnichannel customer experience</h2>
<p>There are different kinds of omnichannel experiences, depending on your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-centric-omnichannel-support-strategy/">customers’ needs</a> and expectations. Beyond communications, the term omnichannel is used in retail and marketing as well. Although the specifics are different, the concept is fundamentally the same: one consistent experience regardless of channel. </p>
<p>An e-commerce company might enable customers to purchase through channels beyond its website, such as inside a messaging thread of a social channel or mobile app while a SaaS company might provide technical support over a mix of channels like email, the phone, and via a chatbot. </p>
<p>But what all good omnichannel experiences have in common is that they create a cohesive journey for the customer as they cycle through channels. Here are 3 examples. </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>UGG® creates a winning omnichannel retail experience</li>
<p>Omnichannel retailing connects a customer’s online, mobile, and in-store visits. </p>
<p>“Click and Collect” and “Click and Reserve” services are one example of how a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/retail-customer-service/">retailer</a> can build an effective omnichannel shopping experience. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/deckers-brands/">UGG® enables</a> a customer to purchase boots online and have them shipped to their local store. </p>
<p>Since digital channels are integrated with a customer’s in-store visits, customers receive a text message to their mobile device when their order is ready and are sent an automated customer service survey after they pick it up. </p>
<li>LimeBike implements a customer-centric omnichannel marketing strategy </li>
<p>Omnichannel marketing requires a business to connect customer data from touchpoints and departments across the organization to ensure a consistent experience that genuinely benefits the customer. </p>
<p>At LimeBike, customer support information is centralized throughout the company. This allows marketing teams to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/limebike/">use customer service data</a> to drive engagement through segmented campaigns over a variety of marketing channels. As a result, both existing and potential customers only get offers relevant to their experience with LimeBike. </p>
<li>Wrike delivers excellent omnichannel customer service</li>
<p>One benefit of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/omnichannel-customer-experience/">omnichannel customer service</a> is the ability to offer both live and asynchronous channels—and create an integrated experience across those channels.  </p>
<p>Wrike offers real-time communication channels like live chat and the phone as well as channels like email and social media that allow customers to pick up a conversation at their own convenience. It also has a help center and community forum to enable customers to self-serve. </p>
<p>All these channels are connected under Wrike’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/customer-service-management-software/">customer service software</a>, which consolidates reporting and ensures agents don’t have to context-switch. </p>
<p>In other words; agents have the customer information they need to resolve every issue <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/wrike/">quickly and effectively</a> no matter how, or when, a customer reaches out. That way, a customer doesn’t have to repeat information like their account type, phone number, or previous problem every time they interact with an agent on a different channel. </p>
<p>For more examples of how brands are creating an omnichannel experience <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/three-companies-three-omnichannel-examples/">read our blog</a>. </p>
<h2>Bring <em>true</em> omnichannel conversations to your customers</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, there’s been a ton of hype around messaging technology and how it&#8217;s transforming the customer experience. But the fragmented nature of the space makes it complicated for businesses to harness the full potential of messaging.</p>
<p>With Zendesk, you can turn the promise of truly omnichannel experience into reality. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You could say that books are having a moment right now. With more people looking for solitary entertainment (and perhaps escape), as well as the rise of the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/anti-racist-reading-lists-what-are-they-for.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-racist reading list</a>, local booksellers are experiencing a “whirlwind,” as one bookseller puts it. </p>
<p>Pete Mulvihill, co-owner of Green Apple Books in San Francisco, says the store (which has three locations in the Bay Area) has made more in sales this year than in the past 12 years combined. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, book printers can’t reprint popular titles fast enough. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/books/printing-companies-backlog-book-publishing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print book sales are up more than 5 percent compared to last year</a>, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, and printers are struggling to tackle a growing backlog amidst mounting financial pressure.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-08-19/usps-changes-hurt-small-businesses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USPS service delays</a> mean that customers have to wait longer,  even when books are in stock and ready to ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print book sales are up more than 5 percent compared to last year, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, and printers are struggling to tackle a growing backlog amidst mounting financial pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understandably, these delays have been disappointing for customers. Frugal Bookstore, Boston’s only Black-owned bookshop, received a number of “disheartening” comments after being inundated with more than 10,000 orders in the span of a few days, <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/books/2020/06/22/frugal-bookstore-customer-backlash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Boston.com reported.</a> </p>
<p>But customers also have a responsibility to consider the larger context, as Massachusetts writer Bradley Babendir pointed out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/therealbradbabs/status/1275028923504525314" rel="noopener" target="_blank">widely shared tweet</a>. </p>
<p>The delays are frustrating for customers and booksellers alike, Mulvihill says. Booksellers have little control, and at the same time, it’s more important than ever to maintain good relationships with customers. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/how-not-to-be-an-asshole-when-you-talk-to-customer-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How not to be an asshole when talking to customer service</a>]</em></p>
<h4>How booksellers are connecting with customers </h4>
<p>In the midst of so many challenges, Green Apple Books is finding success by remaining flexible and being open to new ideas.  </p>
<p>“We tried a ton of different things, and whatever people glommed onto and worked well, we focused on,” Mulvihill says, “It’s been constant pivoting and adapting and shifting and reacting and experimenting.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/pivot-in-the-face-of-change/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to pivot in the face of change</a>]</em></p>
<p>According to Mulvihill, these are a few of the tactics that have stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staying in touch with customers</strong><br />
This has always been important, Mulvihill says, but now Green Apple has to be more creative to keep up with demand. The team has reinvented their processes and are adopting new tools that allow them to collaborate remotely on customer issues. Meanwhile, they’ve increased their social media engagement to share new releases, virtual events, and sometimes, just a <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenAppleBooks/status/1297980338996523008" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moment of levity</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Giving customers the option to pitch in</strong><br />
In the early days of the pandemic, Green Apple Books received a lot of emails from customers asking how they could help, so they decided to put a donation link on their homepage. With just a simple call to action, they raised over $20,000. They also gave customers the option to cover the cost of shipping, and to their surprise, about half of customers who could have had free shipping decided to take on the extra cost. </li>
<li><strong>Engaging the broader community</strong><br />
Green Apple Books has a loyal following, some of whom continue to support the store even after they move outside San Francisco. Using the custom t-shirt platform Bonfire, the bookstore started selling <a href="https://www.bonfire.com/green-apple-books/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">branded t-shirts</a>, tote bags, and yes, even masks that customers from far and wide can buy to help raise money for the store.</li>

<p>“None of these things in and of themselves saved the store,” Mulvihill says, “It’s more about the adaptability and being willing to try different things.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the custom t-shirt platform Bonfire, the bookstore started selling branded t-shirts, tote bags, and yes, even masks that customers from far and wide can buy to help raise money for the store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example is San Francisco’s beloved City Lights Bookstore. Without an ecommerce platform in place, it had to find another way to support the store or risk permanent closure.</p>
<p>City Lights started a fundraiser through GoFundMe, and through the generosity of supporters, raised <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/aeany-keep-city-lights-books-alive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly half a million dollars</a> and were able to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/living-in-sf/article/City-Lights-Bookstore-reopens-doors-today-15346658.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reopen the store</a>. </p>
<p>City Lights Books Publisher and CEO said the following on the store’s GoFundMe page:</p>
<p>“Our GoFundMe campaign solicited your help, and your massive response has been utterly astonishing and much appreciated. A multitude of people [are] responding to our call for help, and I want to thank everyone who has donated so generously — old friends, colleagues, and writers and readers everywhere.”</p>
<h4>A cause customers can get behind: shopping local </h4>
<p>Now booksellers have another tool at their disposal too: A new startup called Bookshop. </p>
<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bookshop</a>, an online bookselling platform designed to help raise money for independent bookstores, launched at the end of January 2020, arriving at perhaps the perfect moment. </p>
<p>Sarah High, partnerships manager at Bookshop, says that they’ve had incredible success despite still being in beta. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/startup-during-pandemic-lessons/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Leading a startup during a pandemic: 5 lessons from 5 founders</a>]</em></p>
<p>“The business was inundated in a wonderful way because we were able to help so many bookstores at a time when they had to close their doors,” High says.</p>
<p>It has been especially helpful for Black-owned bookstores who were flooded with orders in response to the Black Lives Matter movement and Juneteenth celebrations, according to High. Bookshop helped them manage the demand while still getting a financial boost from the sales. </p>
<p>“Bookshop is a great additional tool for them to have to say, ‘My staff is really overworked right now. Go to my Bookshop page, and you’ll be taken care of,’” she explains. “We’re very excited about helping Black-owned bookstores on our site and across the country.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been especially helpful for Black-owned bookstores who were flooded with orders in response to the Black Lives Matter movement and Juneteenth celebrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way it works is that booksellers can create a Bookshop page for their store and direct customers to buy books via the link. Stores get 30 percent of the cover price on sales they make. Bookstores can also join a profit-sharing pool where Bookshop contributes 10 percent of sales they make on the site.</p>
<p>Bookshop is distinct from the <a href="https://www.bookweb.org/about-aba" rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Booksellers Association</a>, a not-for-profit trade organization that helps local bookstores maintain and grow their business, but they share a common goal: supporting local bookstores.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Bookshop has raised over $6 million to support more than 967 bookstores in their profit-sharing pool. </p>
<p>You can see the running total of dollars raised in a banner running across the top of most pages on the website. Additionally, when customers make a purchase, they can see how much money from their purchase will be given to local bookstores. </p>
<p>These little reminders are a key motivator for Bookshop’s socially conscious customers, according to High.</p>
<p>“People are steering toward: How do I conscientiously buy a book? How do I conscientiously support and not undermine my local small business?” High says. </p>
<h4>The next chapter: conscious consumerism</h4>
<p>Mulvihill attributes customers’ generosity to an <a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/has-covid-19-made-the-shop-local-message-more-real-for-consumers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acceleration of the ‘shop local’ movement</a> since the pandemic began. </p>
<p>“People are seeing right now what happens when you stop spending money at your local businesses,” Mulvihill says, “They’re closing, and many of them for good.”</p>
<p>Although major retailers like Amazon and Target <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/tale-two-pandemics-big-box-stores-rake-record-profits-while-n1237464" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have seen record profits</a> during this time, both Mulvihill and High have noticed a shift toward more conscious consumerism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, when customers make a purchase, they can see how much money from their purchase will be given to local bookstores. These little reminders are a key motivator for Bookshop’s socially conscious customers, according to High.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pandemic has been a wake-up call, reminding all of us to take stock and do what we can to help the causes and communities we care about most. For many of us, that means supporting the local businesses we know and love whenever we can. </p>
<p>Customers want to support companies who <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/6-companies-tackling-social-justice-inspiring-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">align with their values</a>. They want to feel like their purchases matter. They want to be part of a movement. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/business-isnt-always-commerce-also-community/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business isn’t always about commerce; it’s about community</a>]</em></p>
<p>“It never works to slam Amazon. They’re one of the most beloved brands in the country,” Mulvihill says. “But it does work to thank people and remind them of the value we bring to our community.” </p>
<p>Small, independent businesses provide good jobs, keep local economies humming, and serve as a point of pride and enjoyment for residents. </p>
<p>So go ahead: Order a book, splurge on carry-out, or treat yourself to something special from a local shop—your community deserves it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What comes to mind when you hear the phrase customer value?</p>
<p>You might think about money&mdash;giving customers a good price for a quality product. And 20 years ago, you&rsquo;d have been right. But today, customer value encompasses much more.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s buyers don&rsquo;t just care about a product&rsquo;s price or even its quality. They also prioritize brand experiences. With tons of shopping options at their fingertips, consumers are looking for companies that align with their values and make them feel good.</p>
<p>So if you want happy customers, you can&rsquo;t focus on monetary costs alone. The key is to deliver both a high-value product and a memorable, positive brand experience.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is customer value?</h2>
<p>Customer value is how much your product is worth to your customers.</p>
<p>lt&rsquo;s not only about price, but how much personal importance a buyer gives to your product. Usually, that value is a mix of its cost, its quality, and what the product can do for that particular person.</p>
</div>
<p>Basically, a product&rsquo;s value is a measure of all the costs and benefits involved in purchasing it. Besides price, customer costs include the time and energy it takes to purchase and learn how to use your product. Customer benefits include the solution your product provides, not only to the buyer but to their organization as well.</p>
<p>Price is universal&mdash;it will cost every customer the same amount to purchase your product. But the product&rsquo;s value will be different for every buyer because it involves so many variables&mdash;including customer experience.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you offer an e-commerce platform where businesses can post their items for sale. You get two new customers&mdash;a large corporation with their own online store and a mom-and-pop business that, until now, has been brick and mortar.</p>
<p>The cost of your product is the same for both companies. But for the corporation, a new e-commerce site in and of itself may not drastically change their business. Getting the mom-and-pop store online, however, can radically grow their sales. Your product&rsquo;s value will likely be much higher for them than for the large business.</p>
<h2>Why customer value isn&rsquo;t just about pricing</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s customers expect more than a quality product at a great price&mdash;they want a high-end customer experience.</p>
<p>Your support team plays a major role in shaping this experience. Roughly <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">half of consumers</a><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/"> say they would switch to a competitor after just one bad customer service experience</a>. On the flip side, many consumers are eager to support brands that offer top-notch customer service.</p>

</aside>
<p>What does high-value service look like? According to our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Customer Experience Trends Report</a>, consumers want problems to be resolved quickly and effectively. Over 60% of customers said fast issue resolution was the most important aspect of good service.</p>
<p>Along with speed, customers want their support experience to be smooth. Sixty-eight percent of customers are annoyed when their call is transferred between departments.</p>
<p>To feel confident about their purchase, customers need more than a list of product specs. They&rsquo;re looking for an exceptional, streamlined service experience.</p>
<h2>How to improve your brand&#8217;s customer value</h2>
<p>In 2020, it isn&rsquo;t enough for support teams to just solve customers&rsquo; problems. Consumers are looking for companies that go above and beyond to make things right for their shoppers. Deliver high-value support by curating your service for each individual customer.</p>
<h3>Personalize your support interactions</h3>
<p>If your support agents recite the same script on every call, your customer base won&rsquo;t be impressed. Show every customer your brand&rsquo;s value by tailoring your service experience to their unique needs.</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Create a personalized onboarding program to start customers on the right foot</strong></p>
<p>Assign each account a support agent who can walk them through implementing your product. For products that require ongoing support, assign a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-success-win-win/">customer success associate</a> to the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use customer info from your CRM to customize your support interactions</strong></p>
<p>Say a customer calls about a problem that they&rsquo;ve experienced in the past. Recognize that this isn&rsquo;t the first time they&rsquo;ve dealt with this frustration, so they feel remembered and understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offer multichannel support options</strong></p>
<p>Provide support on a variety of channels&mdash;email, phone, live chat&mdash;so customers can reach you on the platforms they prefer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on customers&rsquo; individual needs, and you&rsquo;ll be set to deliver the white-glove service they expect from companies.</p>
<h3>Strive for customer success</h3>
<p>Many support teams only focus on resolving current customer issues. But if your view is always short-term, you&rsquo;ll always be putting out fires. Look for ways to prevent issues to make your support experience as smooth as possible.</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Expand your support team</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, your support team should have both customer service reps to solve short-term issues and customer success reps to prevent long-term problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check in with customers regularly</strong></p>
<p>Success managers should connect with customers monthly, if not weekly, to see how they&rsquo;re doing. If they share any potential issues, the manager can form a plan about how they might stop the problem before it gets worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look for patterns in support issues</strong></p>
<p>Success managers should share any customer problems they regularly see with the rest of the support team, so the group can brainstorm potential solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for customers to complain to solve their problems. Try to prevent setbacks as early as possible to keep your customers happy.</p>
<h3>Find opportunities to go above and beyond for customers</h3>
<p>In 2020, retention is all about exceeding consumers&rsquo; expectations. Build a strong long-term relationship with customers by regularly finding ways to wow them.</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure customers know you&rsquo;ve heard them</strong></p>
<p>Send out surveys and use customer feedback to make improvements. Follow up with customers who shared input to let them know how you used their feedback. They&rsquo;ll be happy to hear you valued their ideas and used them to make positive changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acknowledge and reward customer loyalty</strong></p>
<p>Offer a discount or promotion at the end of a support experience for longstanding customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make your customers feel like part of the team</strong></p>
<p>People love feeling included in a community. Build this feeling with your brand by creating a customer community where buyers can go for product support, Q&amp;As, and feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Retention is critical for any business&rsquo;s long-term success. To keep your customers, consistently show them your brand&rsquo;s value with an above-and-beyond support experience.</p>
<h2>Focus on customer value to grow your brand</h2>
<p>People often measure a business&rsquo;s success by its sales. But to gauge a company&rsquo;s long-term success, you have to also consider another factor: the way customers feel <em>after </em>they make a purchase.</p>
<p>To grow your company, customers should consistently feel your product was worth its price tag.</p>
<p>Prioritize quality and offer competitive rates. And of course, deliver an above-and-beyond support experience. Offer customers stellar, personalized service, and they&rsquo;ll likely stick with your brand for years to come.</p>
<p>And creating happy customers that see the value in your brand is key to converting them from one-time buyers to lifetime users.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A contact center and a call center are essentially the same thing, right? Well, yes and no. </p>
<p>Call centers only field phone calls, whereas a contact center offers a variety of other ways for customers to reach out for support: email, chat, self-service, messaging apps, and social media. </p>
<p>Why is it important to understand the difference? While a call center might work for your business, chances are your customers will be better served via a contact center. </p>
<p>Besides meeting customers where they are, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">research</a> shows that top-performing customer service teams benefit from a contact center’s omnichannel capabilities (more on omnichannel in a bit). </p>
<p>And with the ever-increasing amount of customer data being managed by companies, a simple call center can seem as old-fashioned as a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/7vAQDHarOxXWawoTX6/giphy.gif" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rotary telephone</a>. </p>
<p>In this article we’ll explore valuable contact center services and break down everything you need to know about how they work—and most importantly, how they can help your business help customers while improving agent efficiency.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is a contact center?</h2>
<p>A contact center manages inbound and outbound calls while also providing additional ways for customers to get help: email, messaging, chatbots, social media, and self-service.</p>
</div>
<h2>Inbound vs. outbound calling</h2>
<p>Before we dive into contact center services, let’s talk about the difference between <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/inbound-vs-outbound-call-centers-whats-difference/">inbound and outbound</a> call centers. </p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Inbound</h4>
<p>This consists of customers looking to have problems resolved. These incoming calls are handled by support agents.
</li>
<li>
<h4>Outbound</h4>
<p>This includes sales teams that reach out to shoppers via cold calling but can also include market research efforts and surveys. These centers use predictive dialers to automatically call numbers on a list. When a connection is made, the call is handed off to an agent.
</li>
<li>
<h4>Hybrid</h4>
<p>This requires agents to wear two hats, with time split between answering inbound calls and making outbound calls to shoppers.
</li>
</ol>
<p>For inbound call centers, agents handle everything from product and tech support to processing payments and questions about subscription services (whether that’s for SaaS products or meal delivery services and so on).</p>
<p>Outbound call centers focus on lead generation, telemarketing, market research, and more. For smaller companies, these agents are effectively salespeople, but for larger businesses, they might assist an internal sales team by setting up appointments and so on.</p>
<p>Whether inbound, outbound, or a hybrid center, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/improving-phone-support-efficiency/">interactive voice response</a> (IVR) capabilities will help customers find the right agent for their needs.</p>
<h2>How contact center services work</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the different types of call centers, let’s dive into contact center services and how they work. Contact centers offer similar services to call centers, but with a much broader range of channels available for customers. </p>
<p>This is where the word <i><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/omnichannel/">omnichannel</a></i> comes into play, and it’s no overstatement to say that it’s a critical tool for improving the customer experience. To enable omnichannel support, companies increasingly turn to cloud-based contact centers (rather than antiquated and expensive on-premise software). </p>
<p>Here are a few ways omnichannel contact center services—and the software that powers these centers—can boost customer satisfaction and help support agents work more efficiently:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Allows a support organization to automatically triage inbound calls, ensuring maximum efficiency and reduced wait times for customers.</li>
<li>Offers real-time analytics, optimally with the ability to customize reports. This can help organizations identify areas that need improvement and track customer trends.</li>
<li>Provides efficiency tools for agents: scripts, macros, automation, and triggers that give support employees the ability to focus on conversations rather than busy work.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/support-your-support-with-self-service/">Self-service</a>: a contact center can host helpful content that enables customers to resolve issues on their own, which data shows they increasingly prefer. Self-service can also help <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/self-service-decrease-ticket-volume/">lower ticket volume</a>, reduce operational costs, and give agents valuable information that can lead to faster resolution times.</li>
<li>Last but not least: contact centers not only provide customers with multiple ways to reach out for help, they can offer seamless conversations as those customers move across channels. That’s important for a customer base that’s grown accustomed to being able to get help in the most convenient way without having to repeat themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to understand which type of contact center services fit your business needs</h2>
<p>According to Zendesk’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">2020 Customer Experience Trends</a> report, about half of customers would switch to a competitor after a single bad support experience. Add another bad service experience? That number grows to 80 percent. Yikes!</p>
<p>As a support manager, the key to understanding which contact center services your team—and customers—requires evaluating the customer base and the staffing resources at your disposal. A good place to start is by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><b>Which channels do your customers prefer?</b> For example, if your customer base is primarily comprised of Millennials and Gen Z folks, focusing on messaging, live chat, and social media channels might make sense.</li>
<li><b>What are your staffing resources like?</b> If you’re an up-and-coming business—perhaps building out a team of contact center agents for the first time—you might want to start off with basic services. Thankfully, SaaS support solutions often offer trial versions so you can get your bearings and decide what’s important to the business.</li>
<li><b>Will the contact center be prepared to scale with growth?</b> What your customers and agents need right now might not hold when you suddenly experience hockey stick growth. This is where automation and a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence shine.</li>
<h2>Contact center services: why they drive customer loyalty</h2>
<p>It’s all about context! The most effective support tools give companies the ability to link data across channels and systems. That ability to see the complete customer journey—past support requests, products purchased, preferred channels, and so on—is a gold mine for a support team.</p>
<p>Modern contact center services give agents a view into every customer interaction so they can solve problems quickly and without asking customers to repeat themselves or wait while a support professional looks up information. After all, who likes being put on hold? </p>
<blockquote><p>Context opens up proactive engagement opportunities, the hallmark of the intelligent contact center.</p></blockquote>
<p>That being said, context opens up proactive engagement opportunities, the hallmark of the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">intelligent contact center</a>. As <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">research</a> shows, 20 percent of surveyed customers value proactive engagement, a figure that will surely rise in coming years. </p>
<p>By combining self-service, fully informed agents with customer context, a variety of channels, and proactive engagement—as well as internal analytics that can guide support improvements—your company can build a contact center that will maintain a level of customer loyalty that will pay dividends in years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost 30 years ago, Alec Baldwin&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMQrAC7VDRk">profane rant</a> in the movie <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> popularized a simple sales mantra: <em>A.B.C.&mdash;Always Be Closing</em>.</p>
<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s highly quotable monologue is easily the film&rsquo;s best-remembered scene. The actual advice, though? Not quite so timeless.</p>
<p>In 1992, &ldquo;closers&rdquo; weren&rsquo;t competing with computers. But the rise of the Internet has given consumers an alternative way to learn about and purchase products. By 2017, nearly <strong>70% of B2B buyers</strong> said they&rsquo;d <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/05/26/online-self-service-edges-out-reps-for-b2b-buyers/">rather research a product online</a> than talk to a sales rep.</p>
<p>Doing a &ldquo;hard sell&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t easy if people feel they don&rsquo;t even need to talk to you. So what should you do instead?</p>
<p>Put. That coffee. Down&#8230; and let&#8217;s talk about why the 2020 ABCs of sales is <em>Always Be Customer-oriented</em>.</p>
<h2>Why the &ldquo;Always Be Closing&rdquo; methodology is outdated</h2>
<p>Alec Baldwin&rsquo;s character embodies the stereotypical aggressive, hot-shot salesman. He has slicked-back hair and a gold Rolex watch &ldquo;that costs more than your car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No surprise that his &ldquo;always be closing&rdquo; system doesn&rsquo;t take into account the buyer&rsquo;s needs. Instead, it&rsquo;s entirely focused on what the seller wants&mdash;to sell as much as possible.</p>
<p>In his pep talk to struggling sales reps, Baldwin says that &ldquo;only one thing counts in this life: get them to sign on the line which is dotted.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s explicitly endorsing a high-pressure sales technique.</p>
<p>Three decades ago, that may have been the secret to bigger commissions. But today, consumers are smarter, savvier, and harder to push around.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3>Buyers take control of the sales process</h3>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.millerheimangroup.com/resources/news/study-half-of-b2b-buyers-make-up-their-minds-before-talking-to-sales-reps/#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20June%204%2C%202018%20%E2%80%92,division%20of%20Miller%20Heiman%20Group.">CSO Insights</a>, most buyers have already done their research before sales reps contact them. Buyers see less of a need for sellers because they can learn about products and businesses online.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 70% of B2B buyers</strong> have fully defined their needs before connecting with a rep</li>
<li><strong>Nearly 50%</strong> of them have already identified specific solutions</li>
<li>Only <strong>23% of B2B buyers</strong> consider sales reps a top resource for solving business problems</li>
<li>Even worse, just <strong>32% of buyers</strong> say that reps &ldquo;exceed their expectations.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>So how can salespeople prove their value when talking to skeptical prospects? Certainly not by aggressively pushing them to sign on the dotted line.</p>
<p>To be of any use, sellers actually need to be as accommodating and customer-oriented as possible.</p>
<h2>How to &ldquo;Always Be Customer-oriented&rdquo; in 2020</h2>
<p>Being customer-oriented isn&rsquo;t just about being kind and friendly (though that&rsquo;s certainly part of it). It&rsquo;s also about leveraging technology to understand your leads on a meaningful level and find ways of connecting that are convenient for them.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Do your homework" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/always-be-customer-oriented-do-your-homework.png" /></p>
<h3>Do your homework</h3>
<p>With consumers doing so much research on their own, sales reps need to go the extra mile to prove to prospects that they can still be of value. One way to do that? Understand their needs better than anyone else.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t already, research leads and their companies before reaching out. Use <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048813933-Using-Sell-Reach-for-prospecting">prospecting</a> to generate targeted lead lists and <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048813853-Using-Sell-Reach-for-enriching">lead enrichment</a> to get accurate contact information.</p>
<p>If you make contact with a potential buyer over email, ask some preliminary questions before your first call with them. In light of the pandemic, you might ask how COVID-19 has affected their business. Do some research and see what you can find online about how their organization and industry have fared recently.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Listen" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/always-be-customer-oriented-listen.png" /></p>
<h3>Listen, listen, listen</h3>
<p>In your first conversation, be sure to keep your focus on the buyer&rsquo;s needs, not your own. Spend less time pitching and more time listening. Ask <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-questions-close-deal/">open-ended questions</a> that give the prospect room to explain their unique goals, obstacles, and pain points.</p>
<p>Be empathetic and understanding when a buyer is describing their challenges, and resist the urge to immediately pitch a solution. You&rsquo;re still trying to feel things out, and in all likelihood, so is the prospect&mdash;don&rsquo;t be too eager to close quickly.</p>
<p>If you take time to build a relationship, you can help close the &ldquo;apathy gap&rdquo; that makes many modern buyers feel like sales reps aren&rsquo;t necessary to the process.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Embrace digital communication" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/always-be-customer-oriented-embrace-digital-communication.png" /></p>
<h3>Embrace digital communication</h3>
<p>The sales world had already been moving toward digital customer communication in recent years. But because of COVID-19 and the corresponding remote work revolution, that trend has accelerated exponentially:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-pandemic, <strong>52% of sales managers</strong> believed that traditional sales methods were more important to their customers than digital interactions</li>
<li>But now, <strong>66% of sales leaders</strong> now say the new digital approach is equally or more effective than traditional sales methods</li>
<li>Almost <strong>90% of B2B sales</strong> have moved to a videoconferencing, phone, and web sales model</li>
</ul>
<p class="caption">Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-b2b-digital-inflection-point-how-sales-have-changed-during-covid-19">McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p>Digital communications were born of necessity. But they also happen to be more convenient, meaning they fit perfectly with the customer-oriented approach. Just make sure that whatever digital channels you&rsquo;re using to connect deliver on the promise of speed and reliability.</p>
<p>Live chat is a perfect example of a communication channel that can provide quick answers with minimal effort on the part of customers. In fact, McKinsey found that <strong>33% of B2B buyers</strong> rank the live chat option as one of their top requirements for an exceptional supplier.</p>
<h2>Make the new ABC as easy as 123</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Always be customer-oriented&rdquo; requires a lot more patience and effort than &ldquo;always be closing.&rdquo; After all, it takes time and research to understand and connect with leads. Luckily, there are tools that can speed up the process.</p>
<p>With a sales CRM like <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/features/#features">Zendesk Sell</a>, you can easily find and qualify prospects and stay better connected with potential and active customers. And <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/sell/reach/">Zendesk Reach</a> saves reps hours of manual prospecting work by automating lead generation and engagement.</p>
<p>Take advantage of this technology, so your sales team has more time to focus on what matters: building relationships with leads and&mdash;yes, eventually&mdash;<em>closing</em>.</p>

<p>Working in a call center can be a stressful gig. Whether inbound or outbound, in an office setting or at home, call center agents are easily susceptible to burnout. Thankfully, burnout can be managed—but first we need to understand what it is, and how it affects customer service reps. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642">Mayo Clinic</a>, burnout is “<strong>a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity</strong>.” </p>
<p>Put simply, burnout happens when people experience work-related stress for a long period of time. It can manifest as feelings of being overwhelmed, helplessness, or dread. This is a huge problem. Chronic stress can cause long-term mental health issues like depression and anxiety and manifest with physical symptoms like heart disease. Unfortunately, call center agent burnout is totally normal. Customer service jobs require a lot of emotional labor, and it can be difficult to keep up with the fast-paced and results-driven work of call centers. After all, your agents are only human. </p>

<h4>&#8220;Why can’t I get this mundane stuff done? Because I’m burned out. Why am I burned out? Because I’ve internalized the idea that I should be working all the time. Why have I internalized that idea? Because everything and everyone in my life has reinforced it.&#8221;</h4>

<h2>Who experiences burnout?</h2>
<p>Anyone can experience burnout. A Gallup study found that 76 percent of workers experience burnout sometimes, while 21 percent experience burnout very often. As part of our new normal, with workplace conditions constantly changing, it’s easy to assume that workers are feeling burned out more than usual. </p>
<figure>
<img src="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/j/callcenterburnout/burnout1.png" alt="Source: Gallup" /><figcaption> <em>Source: <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288539/employee-burnout-biggest-myth.aspx">Gallup</a></em> </figcaption></figure>
<p>While the face of burnout is often educated, white, able-bodied millennials—a viral 2019 essay proclaimed millennials to be the “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work">burnout generation</a>” — certain groups of people are not well represented in the conversation. Tiana Clark, a poet and creative writing teacher, penned a response calling attention to the fact that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tianaclarkpoet/millennial-burnout-black-women-self-care-anxiety-depression">black women and POC are often left out of the conversation</a>. </p>
<p>“The truth is, I don’t feel like I am allowed to be tired,” she writes. “As a POC millennial, not only am I dealing with the endless emails and the Slack notifications, but I&#8217;m still trying to prove my humanity inside and outside of the workplace.”</p>
<p>Amanda Roosa writes in <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/emotional-labor-in-the-workplace/">Relate</a> that women are over-represented in call centers worldwide because “women have proved to be better at adhering to empathetic scripts and incorporating personal touches when speaking to customers.” Emotional labor, often unrecognized and not compensated, can contribute to burnout just as well. </p>

“Call centre jobs are notorious worldwide for their high levels of turnover, absenteeism, employee burnout, and emotional exhaustion. Agents are at constant risk of angry outbursts from customers, sexual harassment and outright abuse. If women are driven into these low-paid and stressful jobs, where they have little influence and low status, talent will be lost. It also potentially discriminates against men who could and would want to do the job.”<br />

</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>Call center employees are often left out of the burnout conversation alongside myriad fast food, retail, warehouse, and customer service workers that make up the bulk of the modern working class. These people are often older—the <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/soc/customer-service-representatives">median age for customer service reps</a> is 37—and support family members. Call centers specifically can be stressful places to work, and their employees are not well represented in the burnout conversation. </p>
<p>Burnout happens in call centers for the same reasons it happens in other workplaces: stress, unclear expectations, lack of a work-life balance. It should go without saying that call center work is hard. Customers reaching out for help are often unhappy. While many customers prefer to do their own research or use self-service channels for problem-solving, sometimes a conversation is the only way to solve a problem. As messaging and chat gain prominence as customer service tools, there are still many people who <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/successful-call-center/">prefer to pick up the phone</a>.<br />
</section>
<section id="section-3">
<h2>Signs of burnout </h2>
<p>For many people, call center work is the first steady role they’ve held. It isn’t as physically taxing as food service, for example, and many call centers pay higher than minimum wage. But for some call center employees, answering the phone and shooting off emails all day can be emotionally taxing and incredibly tedious. When work is unfulfilling and the only thing keeping somebody tethered to their work is a paycheck, burnout is a likely outcome. </p>
<p>However, when call center reps feel that their labor, knowledge, and time is respected, they will be less likely to burn out. If they feel a sense of mobility within their job, all the better. </p>
<p>As Elissa Reggiardo writes in <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/work-customer-service-go/">Relate</a>, “support is not just answering phones, answering emails, and handling angry customers—it&#8217;s a whole world of solutions development, intuition, empathy, brand management, time management, and a lot more.” In order to feel empowered, it’s important to find allies or mentors and for workers to outline for themselves where they want their support careers to take them. </p>

</div>
<p>Making environmental changes, however, may not be enough. <a href="https://maylentara.com/">Maylen Tara</a>, a thought leader who works to facilitate a dialogue around burnout in the workplace, suggests that employees experiencing burnout should consider therapy. “The first thing I would tell anyone who is experiencing burnout or thinks they may be close to burnout is to go see a therapist,” she told us. “Therapy is the most helpful resource there is for burnout.”<br />

<h2>The manager’s guide to call center burnout </h2>
<h3>How to recognize burnout in employees </h3>
<p>Recognizing when employees are burning out takes a keen eye and a bit of empathy. As Tara explains, “Before the full blow of the burnout, there are the months before when one is lacking motivation and simply exhausted with their work, which may mean that the quality of their work is reduced.”</p>

<h4>Reasons for burnout</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unfair treatment</li>
<li>Unmanageable workload</li>
<li>Lack of role clarity</li>
<li>Lack of communication from managers</li>
<li>Unreasonable time pressure</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p>Is the quality of your direct reports’ work diminishing? Are they frequently late, taking longer breaks, and seem unhappy? Do they seem combative or argumentative? Combined with a stressful work environment, each of these could be an external sign of burnout. </p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about call center burnout is that it is not the individual employee’s fault. While managers have a crucial role in aiding their direct reports through the tribulations of burnout, they can also be a factor behind it. When employees are treated unfairly, micromanaged, or given impossible expectations, burnout is only one outcome to worry about—poor work conditions can increase call center attrition, training costs, and cost a workplace its reputation. </p>
<h3>Being proactive: How to prevent burnout in yourself</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Provide support for employees, but don’t micromanage</h4>
<p>Call centers employees are frequently monitored throughout their shift to collect information about talk time, average handle time, and other metrics that relate both to the customer experience and their own work. As mentioned previously, when the employee experience is tracked—meaning breaks, scheduling, time off, etc.—it can create an environment where good employees feel under appreciated. It is, however, super important to keep track of daily KPIs. Where’s the middle ground?</p>
<p>While micromanagers may have good intentions, it isn’t an effective leadership style. According to Gallup, the key question to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/315530/ultimate-guide-micromanagers-signs-causes-solutions.aspx">recognizing a micromanager</a> is asking, “Is the team customer-obsessed or boss-obsessed?” </p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/11/signs-that-youre-a-micromanager">Micromanagement</a> is when a manager closely observes and controls the work of their employees. Because call centers are heavily dependent on tracking KPIs, managers can easily default to closely tracking employees beyond relevant KPIs, creating an environment where employees feel overwhelmed. Nobody wants to be nitpicked. </p>
<p>Managers can support their employees in a number of ways. Allowing call center employees to take <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/how-to-ask-mental-health-day-from-work/">personal or mental health days</a>, for example—and not holding it above their heads—can foster a better environment for employees. Similarly, scheduling to optimize the workforce can give employees the time they need between shifts to unwind. </p>
<p>Creating opportunities to give critical <em>feedback</em> to employees (rather than criticism) will help employees feel valued and appreciated instead of bogged down. Thoughtful feedback given with context, support, and advice is effectively the opposite of the feedback typical of micromanaging—and, hopefully, will drive the results that managers are ultimately looking for. As <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/call-center-management-3-ways-turn-call-center-experience-center/">we’ve said before</a>, don’t forget the <em>WHY</em> in your KPIs.
</p>
<li>
<h4>Invest in better call center technology </h4>
<p>The technology used in call centers can be a pain point for customer service reps if it’s outdated and cut off from the other bits of software used by the organization. Call center software that allows employees to collaborate across teams, displays relevant information, and is intuitive to use can be the difference between employees feeling empowered or hindered by their workplace.</p>
<p>Legacy call center software (read: dinosaur software) that inhibits agent collaboration, shows irrelevant metrics, or doesn’t include relevant customer information alongside call data can create a frustrating employee experience—and at the end of the day, it’s the customer who will feel this the most. Call center employees want to do their job well, and modern software can help them do that. </p>
<p>Let the employee focus on the task at hand, allow them to provide the best customer service possible, and don’t let them stress about the big picture when it isn’t necessary. </p>
<p>Profit is no longer the bottom line. Customer experience, which begets loyalty, is key. There’s a huge correlation between employee experience and CX—and the ability to combat burnout for call center reps is key for the modern age of customer communications.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>How managers can deal with burnout in call center reps</h3>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Address unfair treatment </h4>
<p>Unfortunately, what constitutes unfair treatment is extremely subjective. Between having HR intervene in workplace conflict or ignoring it all together, managers have a duty to foster the safest, healthiest work environment possible. It’s better for productivity, and it’s better to keep people happy. It’s not an easy task, but a manager can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Prioritizing empathy as a company goal is a great place to start, but may be out of the hands of a call center manager. Fear not: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/practice-empathy-at-work/">empathy training</a>, in which skills like active listening and emotional intelligence are cultivated, can help managers and employees feel understood. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Sort out unmanageable workloads and unreasonable demands</h4>
<p>If employees are finding the workload to be unmanageable, you may want to consider lightening the load. While it might seem completely counterintuitive to suggest lowering expectations in a result-driven work environment, we have to remember that customer service reps are human. Hiring the right agents—people with industry experience and know-how—can balance out employees at the beginning of their career. These are people for whom productivity comes naturally, and they can provide support to struggling employees. </p>
<p>As discussed previously, the software used in call centers can make a big difference in the quality of work. Modern contact center software that includes novel channels like messaging and chat alongside email and phone is better for customers (they like having options!) but also enables agents to work more efficiently. Giving agents the ability to diversify their workstreams can improve the quality of their experience, especially if boredom is a factor. Additionally, modern add-ons to support software like chatbots, automation, and self-service can alleviate the workload from reps by answering easy questions. Analytic tools can help agents self-monitor, which means they won’t necessarily need their manager breathing down their neck in order to hit KPIs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Clarify roles and improve communication</h4>
<p>Lack of <a href="https://www.effectory.com/knowledge/hr-analytics-role-clarity-impacts-performance/">role clarity</a> is commonly cited as a factor in workplace stress. Better role clarity means more satisfaction with leadership, higher productivity, and a higher chance of sticking around. One way of addressing lack of role clarity is by abiding to a consistent cycle of feedback. Whether it’s a daily standup to go over short-term goals or one-on-ones at a regular cadence, consistent feedback and direction can help stressed employees feel centered. <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/performance-review-making-feedback-count/">Most employees do want feedback</a>—even when they’re stressed. If regular feedback isn’t already a part of your call center’s culture, give it a try. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his posthumous letter for the <em>New York Times</em>, Senator John Lewis could have chronicled his many achievements and accolades. He also could have framed his parting words as a harsh rebuke to the institutions and people that carry on America’s legacy of oppression and brutalization for marginalized people. </p>
<p>Instead, Senator Lewis led with gratitude, empathy, and optimism in his dispatch that effectively gifted the torch of the civil rights movement—to which he had devoted six decades of his life—to the next generation. </p>
<p><em>You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society. Millions of people motivated simply by human compassion laid down the burdens of division. Around the country and the world you set aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity.</em></p>
<p>This is extraordinary. And it is also a clear direction to leaders, communities, and individuals that the steps we take that will push us forward must come from a place of gratitude. </p>
<p>As we struggle together through these turbulent, unprecedented, incredibly nuanced and isolating times, we begin to see that gratitude as a lifeline to our emotional survival is critical. We can no longer relegate this underused virtue to rarified greeting cards and Thanksgiving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we struggle together through these turbulent, unprecedented, incredibly nuanced and isolating times, we begin to see that gratitude as a lifeline to our emotional survival is critical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12585811/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a study</a> conducted by leading psychologists Dr. Robert A. Emmons of the University of California, Davis, and Dr. Michael E. McCullough of the University of Miami, expressing gratitude improves health, focus, energy levels, and can be a game changer for depression and stress.</p>
<p>In one of their seminal <a href="https://emmons.faculty.ucdavis.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research projects on gratitude</a>, the psychologists found that “after 10 weeks, those who wrote about gratitude [daily] were more optimistic and felt better about their lives. Surprisingly, they also exercised more and had fewer visits to physicians than those who focused on sources of aggravation,” according to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/in-praise-of-gratitude-201211215561" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article</a> published on Harvard Health Publishing.</p>
<p>Those same participants who journaled daily about gratitude also said they had helped someone with a personal problem or were more inclined to offer emotional support to another. So what we’re talking about in the example above is the potential for a little bit of extended gratitude on a regular basis to build a much-needed (and necessary) ecosystem by which we feel held up by one another. </p>
<p>Additional studies on gratitude <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have shown</a> that regularly occurring episodes of gratitude improve relationships, and that “managers who remember to say ‘thank you’ to people who work for them may find that those employees feel motivated to work harder.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/giving-getting-gratitude-at-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gratitude at work: why giving is as good as getting</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Building a culture of gratitude</h4>
<p>So let’s imagine your workplace at the moment. The endless Zoom meetings, the barrage of emails, chats, and other pings you are fielding nonstop. All the while balancing the emotional duress of social isolation or the pressures of being a caregiver. Perhaps a spouse has lost their job and your financial footing isn’t as stable as it once was. It’s a long list, right?</p>
<p>But in your day-to-day interactions, you are given regularly-occurring feedback that expresses gratitude for your perseverance. In meetings, the host closes it with thanking everyone for their time. Your manager kicks off each 1:1 acknowledging your hard work or expressing gratitude for your endurance of a trying time. First off, that’s got to feel pretty good, right? You feel heard, seen, recognized, understood. And when that kind of nurturing takes hold, it’s only natural you want to pay it forward; to make sure the next person you encounter also is reassured that everything they are doing right now is important, appreciated, and valuable. And so on and so forth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when that kind of nurturing takes hold, it’s only natural you want to pay it forward; to make sure the next person you encounter also is reassured that everything they are doing right now is important, appreciated, and valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we are looking at is an entire ecosystem of care being created simply by ensuring gratitude is every bit a best practice for reimagining your workplace as providing the proper IT equipment for remote work. As snacks and onsite perks of the workplace fall further into irrelevance, it will be the social emotional qualities of things like gratitude that become the cultural glue that keep it all together. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/holding-onto-rituals-weve-learned-love-shelter-place/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Holding onto the rituals we’ve learned to love as we shelter in place</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Small shifts can lead to big change</h4>
<p>Let’s take it outside the workplace. What if when you wake up each morning you try to find something you are thankful for? It can be as big as being grateful for your health or the health of your children or as small as how that first sip of coffee in the morning is truly the most glorious sensation in the world. Say you are grateful for your morning walk, that goat yoga exists, or that your neighbor waves to you every time they see you. The idea is to surface those small connections that can really mean everything. What are the chances you bring that same positive energy to your next interaction? That the simple act of remembering there are things that still make sense can be what helps you bring your best self to as many situations as possible, and inspires others to bring their best selves as well. </p>
<p>As we look to what the future holds for business, communities, and humankind, it will be gratitude (among other things) that helps lead the way, take down the barriers in our physical and virtual spaces, and potentially dawn a new era of relationships grounded in the simple, easy-to-do act of letting each other know that we are grateful for one another, especially now. </p></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may remember <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay-microsofts-ai-chatbot-gets-a-crash-course-in-racism-from-twitter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tay</a>, Microsoft’s infamous Twitter chatbot that unintentionally picked up on hate speech and became a racist, sexist jerk overnight. Tay became a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>Since then our ability to monitor biases with respect to artificial intelligence (AI) has improved, and it’s continuously advancing. </p>
<p>“We’re getting better at measuring data sets and de-biasing algorithms. For instance, someone <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/07/27/158634/how-vector-space-mathematics-reveals-the-hidden-sexism-in-language/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mathematically measured</a> sexism in a data set was that was associating ‘nurse’ with female and ‘doctor’ with male,” said <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1263734/5028473-ep39-mikey-fischer-phd-student-at-stanford-university" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mikey Fischer</a>, who developed a system that translates natural language into code and recently completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford University, specializing in AI and Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>AI can learn both good and bad things, but it depends on what it’s fed. This puts the onus on businesses creating and using it to become more accountable and operate carefully and with empathy. </p>
<p>Businesses need AI to create the personalized, effortless experiences customers expect. But they’ll also need to take steps to ensure they don’t birth a bot like Tay that amplifies our worst biases and disenfranchises groups of people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI can learn both good and bad things, but it depends on what it&#8217;s fed. This puts the onus on businesses creating and using it to become more accountable and operate carefully and with empathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>7 ways to reduce bias in conversational AI</h4>
<p><strong>1. Opt for transparency and explainability </strong><br />
Whether we’re talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon’s facial recognition software</a> mistaking minority members of Congress for criminals or Cambridge Analytica <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">harvesting data</a> to impact the 2016 U.S. presidential election, there needs to be transparency into how companies operate with respect to AI and <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/what-exactly-is-meant-by-explainability-and-interpretability-of-ai-bcea30ca1e56" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explainability</a>—which means understanding why an AI system made a certain decision. </p>
<p>“Companies that are transparent with technology or make it open access tend to get into fewer issues,” said Fischer. “Businesses get into trouble with AI when they over-promise or hide things, not necessarily because the technology isn’t perfect—everyone understands there are limitations to technology.” </p>
<p>Just like companies are transparent about pricing or business values, they can be open about AI, like what their technology can and can’t do, and internal processes around it. This also means being honest when something goes wrong. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Companies that are transparent with technology or make it open access tend to get into fewer issues.&#8221; — Mikey Fischer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transparent businesses also ensure customers know where they are in the system when interacting with AI, according to Fischer. For instance, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-california-its-now-illegal-for-some-bots-to-pretend-to-be-human#:~:text=Known%20as%20the%20B.O.T%20(%E2%80%9CBolstering,person%20about%20its%20artificial%20identity.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the &#8220;B.O.T law&#8221;</a> requires companies to inform customers in California when they’re talking to a chatbot instead of a human.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/regulating-ai-call-for-transparency-ethical-use/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Regulating AI—a call for transparency and ethical use</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Allow for a diverse set of viewpoints</strong><br />
Ethical tech means both being transparent and allowing for a diverse set of viewpoints, according to Fischer. </p>
<p>In 2017, a video went viral of a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4800234/Is-soap-dispenser-RACIST.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">soap dispenser</a> that only responded to white hands—because it wasn’t tested on other skin types. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/5/18251924/self-driving-car-racial-bias-study-autonomous-vehicle-dark-skin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Another study</a> found that self-driving cars had trouble detecting pedestrians with dark skin, again because the technology was only built to recognize white people.</p>
<p>Businesses need to hire diverse teams and test algorithms on diverse groups—or they’ll get unsettling outcomes that magnify hidden prejudices of a monocultural workforce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Businesses need to hire diverse teams and test algorithms on diverse groups—or they&#8217;ll get unsettling outcomes that magnify hidden prejudices of a monocultural workforce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Build chatbots that are contextual and use-case specific</strong><br />
Businesses can reduce bias by creating chatbots that are contextually relevant and use-case specific, according to Fischer.</p>
<p>“When AI is set for a task that’s too broad, there is no way for it to be unbiased because a lot of what is ethical is contextually relevant,” said Fischer. “When we&#8217;re all forced into a monoculture of technology, it’s not really possible for it to hit all the nuances of a given demographic or whoever the AI is trying to serve.” </p>
<p>Examples of domain-specific chatbots—chatbots set for a specific task—include <a href="https://www.answeriq.com/customers/freshly" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freshly’s bot</a> that answers frequently asked customer service questions, Bank of America’s <a href="https://promo.bankofamerica.com/erica/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Erica</a>, which helps clients manage their finances, or the World Health Organization’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-launches-whatsapp-chatbot-coronavirus-information-2020-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WhatsApp bot</a> that provides users with reliable information around COVID-19. </p>
<p>“It’s about being user and use-case specific so the chatbot has enough context to give it the ability to be ethical,” said Fischer. “If it has a specific task, the user and the system have more of the melding of the minds.” </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/context-leads-better-chatbots-better-conversation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">More context leads to better chatbots—and better conversation</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Rate chatbots against our own biases</strong><br />
A chatbot is based on any number of inputs we give it, learning from the world the way it is or has been, <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/science-and-health/2017/4/17/15322378/how-artificial-intelligence-learns-how-to-be-racist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not as it should be</a>. As a result, we pass on our biases—conscious or unconscious.</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as an unbiased system,” Fischer explained. “AI is always based on some definition of fairness that it’s trying to optimize for and there are many definitions of what fair means.”</p>
<p>The example Fischer gave was a chatbot for creditworthiness. Do you define creditworthiness as someone more likely to pay back a loan or optimize it to maximize profit? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;AI is always based on some definition of fairness that it&#8217;s trying to optimize for and there are many definitions of what fair means.&#8221; — Mikey Fischer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even when we think we’ve programmed AI without bias, it can learn prejudices we may not realize we have. </p>
<p>“AI systems have millions of parameters and sometimes it’s not immediately clear to a human the reason why a decision was made,” said Fischer. “Even the most careful parents can produce a child that is far from what they expected.” </p>
<p>A bank might find that its creditworthiness algorithm is biased on race and remove race as an input. But the algorithm can statistically deduce race from other factors, like geographical location or where someone went to college. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to fully remove discriminating factors,” said Fischer. That’s why, as people responsible for building the AI experiences of the future, we need to rate chatbots against our own biases.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/5-innovative-ways-brands-using-bots-help-customers-connect/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5 innovative ways brands are using bots to help customers connect</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Collect better data</strong><br />
Chatbots are a byproduct of data they receive. AI isn’t magic—it’s subject to biased data in, biased data out. </p>
<p>But not all preconceived notions about a customer are bad. They can create easier, better-personalized experiences. For instance, Spotify recommends songs to users based on their previous listening behavior. </p>
<p>The important thing is that you ensure an algorithm isn’t using what it already knows about someone for harm. This requires analysts to interpret data carefully before feeding it to machines and evaluate the outcomes of that data. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When AI is set for a task that&#8217;s too broad, there is no way for it to be unbiased because a lot of what is ethical is contextually relevant.&#8221; — Mikey Fischer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Collecting data has other nuances in it, too. For example, most data online is extreme. </p>
<p>“Say you were collecting Instagram pictures. Instagram pictures are not a reflection of real life. They’re the crème de la crème,” said Fischer. “A lot of data online is similarly polarizing.” </p>
<p>It helps to collect more routine and less inflammatory data that shows how a system will actually be used as well as rate data specifically for the human values you’ll program into it, like fairness or equal opportunity. </p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re not careful about these things, you’ll get unexpected outcomes around biases. The worst-case scenario is unknowingly disenfranchising a certain group of people,” said Fischer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing is that you ensure an algorithm isn’t using what it already knows about someone for harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6. Keep a human in the loop</strong><br />
Businesses get the greatest value from AI when using augmented intelligence—human intelligence and machine intelligence combined. </p>
<p>Machines don’t actually know what they’re doing. “They’re just regurgitating what’s already there,” said Fischer.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to keep a human in the loop to evaluate for biases even after testing a system, making sure it works for specific users, and looking at individual use cases as opposed to global demographics, according to Fischer. </p>
<p>It also helps to have a fallback system so customers can contact a real person if they encounter something unexpected or inaccurate. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/ai-helping-solve-human-problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5 ways AI is helping solve human problems</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>7. Become end-user-centric</strong><br />
AI is most successful when it serves the benefits of who’s directly using it: the end-user. </p>
<p>Becoming end-user-centric requires a business to use empathy when designing AI systems, display humanity, and operate with a conscience. </p>
<p>Businesses can take a more human approach to AI by empowering the end-user through a feedback loop. </p>
<p>If a chatbot answers customers’ frequently asked questions, a customer might have the ability to give feedback via text, a form, or a thumbs up or thumbs down icon. They can also indicate that they’re unsatisfied by asking to reach a real person.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, Fischer believes AI will be less biased if those it serves can amend it themselves—and that empowering end-users to make AI systems more powerful will lead to the next breakthrough in AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to keep a human in the loop to evaluate for biases even after testing a system, making sure it works for specific users, and looking at individual use cases as opposed to global demographics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/mf545qw7152" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fischer’s Ph.D.</a> was on creating AI that people can adjust, such as by reframing preconceived notions, without knowing how to program.</p>
<p>“In my Ph.D., you could program by demonstration and instruct the computer as if you were telling another person. Today, Siri says, ‘I can’t do that for you,’ but in my vision of the future, Siri will say, ‘I can’t do that for you, but could you show me how?’” said Fischer. “When there are end-users from a variety of backgrounds contributing to AI, and customizing it for their own needs, it’ll be more helpful and representative of the people.” </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/designing-products-for-user-pain-points/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bringing empathy to product design</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Ethical tech isn’t a buzzword; it’s a business necessity </h4>
<p>Research tells us that AI is key to delivering a frictionless customer experience. But that’s table stakes. </p>
<p>Customers also expect companies to operate with integrity and human values. This requires businesses to bake empathy, transparency, and trust into their DNA, especially with respect to AI—because when they don’t, the results can be unexpected and even terrifying. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year we’ve seen an unexpected acceleration of cloud and software companies, driven by the sudden shift to remote work. In particular, business-to-business (B2B) software is “<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/startup-takeaways-b2b-software-is-having-a-moment-and-investors-say-its-a-good-time-to-get-on-board/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">having a moment</a>,” and the trend seems likely to continue. </p>
<p>In this context, the announcement of this year’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#e6793b85f941" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forbes Cloud 100 List</a> takes on a new significance. The Cloud 100 is a list of the top cloud and software as a service (SaaS) companies based on factors including growth, sales, valuation and culture, as well as a reputation score determined with help from their public cloud company peers, which this year included Zendesk. </p>
<p>More than 75 percent of the Forbes Cloud 100 use Zendesk to help give their customers a great experience, suggesting that customer experience (CX) plays a role here too. Read on to see why so many of these startups are investing in CX—and why you should be too.  </p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Cloud companies know their software needs to be seamless, and they want their customer service to be seamless too. </h4>
<p>Less than a third of startups we surveyed for our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/campaign/startups-benchmark/">Startups CX Benchmark Report 2020</a> had a CX solution in place, but many of the Cloud 100 winners do. These companies are in a unique position to recognize the value of good CX because the success of their software depends on it. </p>
<p>Companies such as Culture Amp and Airtable need to have an intuitive user interface that customers love to use. It makes sense that they’d want their customer service to be just as seamless. They’re investing in solutions that make life easier for the customer, and based on their success, it seems the investment is paying off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>In an ever-changing world, it’s more important than ever to be able to meet your customers where they are.</h4>
<p>Elena Gomez, Chief Financial Officer at Zendesk, says this year has been a long lesson in the need for organizational agility and flexibility to underpin everything you do. </p>
<p>“SaaS companies are well positioned to embrace this constant change as nimbleness is built into their core,” she says. One of the ways they’re doing that is by meeting their customers where they are.</p>
<blockquote><p>SaaS companies are well positioned to embrace this constant change as nimbleness is built into their core.<br />
   <cite>Elena Gomez, Chief Financial Officer, Zendesk</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is consistent with other successful startups. In our startups benchmark, we found that 25 percent of fast-growing startups added omnichannel support within the first two years of founding. Omnichannel makes it easy to connect with customers on the channels they prefer—even when their preferences suddenly shift, like we’ve seen with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/home-bound-customers-turn-to-messaging/">more customers relying on messaging</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>There’s no shortage of competition among cloud software companies, and CX can be a differentiating factor.</h4>
<p>More companies are likely to enter the cloud software market in the years ahead. As competition intensifies, SaaS companies will need to rely on more than just their product to set themselves apart. </p>
<p>Good CX is one way you can win customers over. More than half of customers said they would switch to a competitor after just one bad customer service experience, according to our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/">Customer Experience Trends Report 2020</a>. This suggests that for companies facing stiff competition, CX is a good investment. It may also explain why so many Cloud 100 companies are prioritizing it.</p>
<p>Further, over 60% of customers said speedy issue resolution was their top priority when evaluating customer service, and our startups benchmark showed that companies who prioritized CX investments were resolving customer issues twice as fast as their counterparts after two years.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>We will face many challenges in the months and years ahead, and the Cloud 100 companies are no exception. But according to Gomez, if there’s anything we can learn from these successful cloud companies, it’s that putting customers first pays off.</p>
<p>“As we look ahead to 2021, we should all be thinking about how we can continue to help our customers, our people, and our communities,” Gomez says. “Growth and scale starts with prioritizing the customer experience—whatever challenges lie ahead.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People don’t generally open their wallets to spend money without getting something in return. Even when making a donation, there’s an incentive like feeling good or connecting to a cause. To be successful, businesses need to tap into unmet customer needs and offer solutions. </p>
<p>Sounds simple — but how do you actually find out what’s on your customers’ minds?</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>What are customer needs?</h2>
<p>Customer needs are the psychological and physical motivations that make someone want to purchase a product or service.
</p></div>
<h3>Physical needs vs. psychological needs</h3>
<p><strong>Physical needs</strong> are usually easier to identify, because they’re much more tangible. If you have a cold, you need cough syrup. If you’re tired, you need to sleep. If you’re hungry, you need to eat. This is why physical needs are at the bottom level of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a> &#8211; in order for people to move up the pyramid, these basic needs must be met.</p>
<p>In business, the quality of your product or service is closely tied to your customers’ physical needs. For example, a cafe guest is hungry and tired, so they need a scone and an espresso. Or, a shopper is cold in the wintry weather, and they stop into your store because they need a warm pair of mittens. These behaviors can be mapped to certain physical needs, but they’re also intertwined with more complex psychological needs, like a feeling of belonging or an affinity to a particular brand.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological needs </strong>come into play when there’s an emotional reason behind the purchase. Once those basic physical needs are met, the reasons behind purchases become emotional. Any pair of shoes might be just fine to fulfill a physical need for clothing. But you know your favorite brand donates a pair for each one purchased, and that aligns with your personal values. It’s probably cheaper to make your own coffee at home, but it would be more fun to run into Starbucks for a Pumpkin Spice Latte.</p>
<p>Impulse buying is an excellent example of a want becoming a need. Did you really need that fizzy bath bomb? Maybe. Or, maybe it just felt good in the moment — and you needed a little happiness boost. The point is, people are complex creatures, and so are their needs. </p>
<p>Psychological needs are a heavy factor when it comes to brand loyalty. According to the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report</a>, 74% of customers feel loyal to a particular brand or company, and 52% of customers say they go out of their way to shop with their favorite brands. Understanding the link between loyalty and customer experience is vital. Loyalty is tied to a customer’s ongoing choice to do business with you, refer others to you, and have a sense of a positive relationship with you. In today’s competitive marketplace, good customer experience can drive success of a business. </p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Person with binoculars" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog-redesign/Artboard 2680x360px_Olive_Oyl@2x.png" /></p>
<h2>Identifying customer needs</h2>
<p>So how can you find out what your customers need? There are a few tried-and-true methods to consider.</p>
<h3>Focus groups</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-a-market-research-focus-group-2296907" rel="noopener" target="_blank">focus group </a>is a group of deliberately chosen people who participate in a discussion on a specific topic. These groups are run by market research and are facilitated by a moderator to encourage everyone’s active participation. </p>
<p>Focus groups are great for getting a sense for consumers’ feelings and perceptions about your brand. They can also help you gather psychographic data — information about a person&#8217;s values, interests, and attitudes, and what triggers them to act.</p>
<h3>Customer surveys</h3>
<p><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/customer-surveys/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Surveys</a> are a traditional way to gather information from larger groups of people. Most surveys are in Q&#038;A format to provide metrics. Millions of surveys are sent out each year, and are now mostly done online. </p>
<p>If you want to understand what current customers (or potential customers) think of your product or brand, a survey can help you glean these insights. But surveys are only as good as their design — it’s crucial to be clear on what you want to know, how you word questions, who your demographic is, and how the survey is structured.</p>
<h3>Social media listening</h3>
<p>More and more businesses are seeing the importance of being present on social media for customer service. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/">Data shows that your customers want to communicate</a> with you in the same way they do with friends and family — and that often means social channels. </p>
<p>Connecting with customers on their preferred channel also helps to create a more meaningful relationship. And, it’s an excellent way to hear real-time feedback from your customers about what they like (and what they don’t). If you start to see the same questions or issues pop up over time, it’s a good clue that you have a customer need to solve for.</p>
<h3>Keyword research</h3>
<p>The last time you were wondering where to find the best pair of hiking boots, what did you do? Most likely, you searched online for advice. That’s what makes keyword research so important &#8211; it helps a business identify popular search terms and phrases people key into search engines. See where your company is ranking compared to competitors by doing an “incognito” search for your industry or product. If you aren’t on the first page, you aren’t as likely to be found by your customers. This is a crucial insight for small businesses and enterprises alike.</p>
<p>People look for different information depending on where they are in the customer journey. For example, “hiking boots” will turn up a much different search engine results page (SERP) than “hiking boots for women size 8.” The first is a top-of-funnel informational search, whereas looking for a specific size indicates a greater intent to purchase. By investing some time in keyword research, you can optimize your website to rank higher in search results, and gain insights about what your customers are searching for.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“The experience matters at every moment in the customer journey, and customers will judge any impediment along the way. It’s crucial to consider the experience from the customer’s perspective to understand their needs.”<br />
<cite>Harry Wray, Customer Success Executive at Zendesk</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Customer journey mapping</h3>
<p>To meet your customers needs, you need to understand what they’re looking for and what phase of the customer journey they’re in, from discovery to purchase. Customer journey mapping is the process of creating a visual representation of your customers’ interactions with your brand. It helps you see things from your customers’ perspective, and gain insights about potential roadblocks and how to improve the experience.</p>
<p>“The experience matters at every moment in the customer journey, and customers will judge any impediment along the way,” said Harry Wray, Customer Success Executive at Zendesk. “It’s crucial to consider the experience from the customer’s perspective to understand their needs.”</p>
<p>Data shows that paying attention to customer experience is critical. According to the Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report, roughly half of customers say they would switch to a competitor after just one bad experience. That number increases to 80% after more than one bad experience. To keep your customers happy and create loyalty, you need to optimize your CX. Customer journey mapping is a tool you can use to find ways to create those good experiences.</p>
<h2>How to predict customer needs (and prepare to meet them)</h2>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>You don’t need a crystal ball to predict your customer needs &#8211; but you do need data. The good news is, your customers are creating and sharing more data with you than ever before. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#1ae17ffe60ba" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day.</a> To put that number in perspective, it would take about 210,000 years for a quintillion gallons of water to go over Niagara Falls. It’s a colossal amount of information. But most companies aren’t using their customer data to make business decisions.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) use science to predict what might happen in the future — from what your customers need to the big trends. Netflix, for example, tailors watch lists for each subscriber based on their data profile — demographics, ratings, watch history and preferences influence what the algorithm will recommend. And, the focus on machine learning has proven to deliver results: about 80% of what’s watched on Netflix is based on these AI-powered recommendations.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Shaking hands" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog-redesign/EmailSystem-216_Final_x2.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Know your customers</h3>
<p>This one might sound obvious, but how well do you actually know your customers? To make demand forecasting effective, you need to collect and integrate data about your customers, your offerings, and the triggers to purchase. Then you can create a buyer persona for each of your customer segments and plan marketing and product strategies for each.</p>
<p>This starts with the basics: demographic customer data like age, location, psychographic lifestyle and income. Previous purchases are often a good clue to what a customer will buy next. That data is usually easier to collect in online channels like in-app purchases or social media click throughs. It can be a bigger challenge to collect this data from offline channels — and this is where loyalty programs can be extremely helpful for tracking buying behavior. </p>
<p>On top of fostering a better customer relationship, loyalty programs can help businesses get to know their customers better. That, in turn, helps them create a better customer experience and the circle continues.</p>
<h3>Know the buying patterns of your target customers</h3>
<p>It’s critical to <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/12/know-what-your-customers-want-before-they-do" rel="noopener" target="_blank">understand context </a>when you’re trying to predict customer needs. How do your customers prefer to contact you? If you aren’t present on their channel of choice (email, phone, social media, app) you are missing out on an opportunity. Other factors can affect customer demand — including the season, state of the economy, and even time of day. If your product is a quick impulse item like a candy bar, you’ll plan for it differently than a long-lead luxury piece like a diamond ring. Understanding customer behavior and planning to meet their demands.</p>
<p>Companies that collect and analyze data about their customers, their purchase patterns, and the context can create much more targeted offers. For example, some companies can predict whether you’re likely to get married soon based on purchase patterns and tailor their marketing offers to that context. It’s also possible to predict whether a customer is more likely to respond to an offer via mobile through data analytics.</p>
<h2>Focus on your customers</h2>
<p>Understand what your customers need and how to meet their expectations means putting them first. Design your business around what they want to achieve, and dig into your data to deliver great customer experiences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know based on our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/campaign/startups-benchmark/">Startups CX Benchmark Report 2020</a> that fast-growing startups use more apps than their slower-growth counterparts. But with so many app options available, how do you decide which ones you need? </p>
<p>While there’s no one right answer, it helps to hear from people who’ve been through it before. Read on for an overview of helpful apps for startups from our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/startups/">Zendesk for Startups</a> team. </p>
<h2>How apps can help fuel startup growth</h2>
<p>As a startup, your superpower is agility. The last thing you want to do is overwhelm your team by adding too many tools at once or not carefully considering your options–and there are a lot of options.</p>
<p>But if you go about it the right way, apps can simplify and elevate your business processes without creating more friction for your team. You might already use collaboration apps like Slack or Zoom, and by integrating them with your trusted tools, you can help your team access customer data, move quickly to solve customer problems, and remain on the same page throughout the process.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Startups should aim to add a new app or integration every four to five months<br />
<cite>Startups CX Benchmark Report 2020</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>As you continue to grow, you’ll need apps to help you scale without adding complexity. Integrations can streamline your internal processes so your teams can continue to be productive and efficient as you evolve from a team of 10 to a team of 100 or more. </p>
<p>Based on the behavior of fast-growing startups in our benchmark, we found that startups should aim to add a new app or integration every four to five months to have at least five in place by year two. </p>
<h2>Popular apps for startups</h2>
<p>Here are some app categories that are popular for companies with less than 100 employees, which are common for some of the use cases startups are trying to solve for. </p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Apps</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collaboration</td>
<td>Slack, Zoom, Trello, and TeamViewer, Productboard </td>

<tr>
<td>Agent productivity</td>
<td>Tymeshift, Five Most Recent, Kaizo, Knowledge Capture, Tray.io</td>

<tr>
<td>Feedback and reviews</td>
<td>SurveyMonkey, Trustpilot, Stella Connect, AppFollow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ecommerce and marketing </td>
<td>Shopify, Mailchimp, ChannelReply, and ShipStation</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7 app integrations to improve your CX</h2>
<p>Apps play an important role not just for your internal teams, but also for your customers. With the right apps, you can provide faster service and reduce customer effort. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/">Zendesk Marketplace</a> you can explore more than 1,000 apps, integrations and partners that can help you make the most of your favorite Zendesk tools including Support, Chat, and Sell. Some apps cost extra but many others are free, so you can decide based on what your budget allows. </p>
<p>There are so many options, but these apps are a good starting point for many teams, and they were some of the most popular among the startups in our benchmark. </p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Slack</h4>
<p>Many startups use <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/slack/?q=mkp_slack">Slack</a> for team communication, and by integrating Slack with Zendesk Support, you can ensure your entire team is in the loop on important customer issues. Slack helps you bring all your customer support interactions into a single place. You can use Slack messaging actions to create tickets and add comments within seconds as well as receive real-time notifications on tickets in a designated Slack channel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowledge Capture </h4>
<p>Your employees are the true experts on your business because they live and breathe it every single day. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/knowledge-capture/?q=mkp_knowledge%20cap">Knowledge Capture</a> leverages your team’s collective knowledge by enabling your agents to search and link help center articles into tickets and create new articles while answering tickets via a template in the Zendesk Support agent workspace. Plus, data about app activities is captured in a custom dashboard showing key metrics for ticket impact, agent performance, and content performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>User Data</h4>
<p>When you’re a startup, every customer interaction counts. With the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/user-data/?q=mkp_user%20data">User Data</a> app for Zendesk Support, you can see customer information right away, so you know exactly who you’re talking to and how they can best be helped. Key information including the user, organization, tags, ticket activity, and contact information is available right in the agent workspace. This gives you a holistic view of their past interactions with your company, so you can provide a more tailored response.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Time Tracking</h4>
<p>Startups are sometimes skeptical of workforce management tools, but when used appropriately, they can be a game changer. With the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/time-tracking/?q=mkp_time%20tracking">Time Tracking</a> app, you can easily identify which customers send in the most complicated tickets, or which issue types take the longest for your team to resolve. You can also dig down into an agent’s tickets to discover which issues they&#8217;re experts on and which require more time. With this information, you can focus on aligning your team to play to each individual&#8217;s strengths.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>JIRA</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s a digital world, which means you&#8217;ll need to help your customers solve complex technical problems. With Zendesk Support for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/jira/?q=mkp_Jira">JIRA</a>, your support and engineering teams will always be on the same page whenever a development issue arises. You can easily escalate and link Zendesk Support tickets to a JIRA issue so critical info is shared and collaboration is effortless. This ensures a complete view of customer conversations related to an issue, with customizations available to fit your workflows. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Zendesk Sell</h4>
<p>As an emerging startup, you have the opportunity to break down silos before they even start. Apps can help you connect your teams via the tools they&#8217;re already using. When you add the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/zendesk-sell/?q=mkp_sell">Zendesk Sell</a> app, your support agents can get more context from the sales process, and they can notify sales of opportunities surfaced during a support conversation. Additionally, Zendesk Support tickets can be accessed directly from Zendesk Sell, so you can connect buyers with closers and get a complete picture of a customer’s current experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpdesk Migration</h4>
<p>Need to migrate data from your previous support solution? You&#8217;re not alone. Many startups find themselves in this position when they discover that the solutions they relied on in the early days can no longer keep up. The <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/help-desk-migration/">Helpdesk Migration</a> app can help make the transition to Zendesk even easier. Migrate from over 30 different platforms and retain important information including past tickets, user information, custom fields, etc.
</p>

<p>Customers always had the power to recommend (or discredit) a brand to their friends or family. But being constantly connected has given them greater ability to influence many other customers&#8217; buying decisions as well, whether they’re posting a Tweet or writing a Yelp review. </p>
<p>Here, we’ll cover how reviews impact a business’s bottom line, the best review sites, strategies for inspiring customers to write good reviews, and how to respond to negative ones.</p>

<h2>What are customer reviews?</h2>
<p>Customer reviews are feedback about a business’s product, service, or overall customer experience. Customers write reviews on a business’s website, third-party review websites such as Yelp, or social media.</p>

<p><span id="The importance of customer reviews"></p>
<h2>The importance of customer reviews</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>From retail to B2B SaaS, reviews impact how customers perceive your business, which ultimately affects profits.</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Customer reviews build trust</li>
<p>Customer reviews show social proof and boost a brand’s online reputation. They’re powerful because they come from real people as opposed to a business, which makes them feel more authentic than traditional marketing.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2015/global-trust-in-advertising-2015/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research shows</a> that people trust word-of-mouth more than brand advertising. </p>
<p>83 percent of customers say they trust friends and family, which isn’t surprising. But <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/11/customer-loyalty-report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">66 percent say</a> they trust opinions strangers post online, with 91 percent of millennials trusting <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/one-star-two-stars-three-stars-four-the-tricky-business-of-online-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online reviews</a> as much as friends and family.</p>
<p>“Customer reviews are essentially word-of-mouth online,” said Emily Washcovick, Senior Field Marketing Manager at Yelp. “In our digital age, customers can get feedback from both people they care about and know in real life and other consumers who had real experiences via online reviews.”</p>
<li>They provide valuable feedback</li>
<p>From the quality of your product to the ease of your sales cycle and effectiveness of your customer support, reviews provide valuable insight into what’s working well for your customer-audience and where there’s room for improvement.</p>
<p>“Reviews enable businesses to keep an open eye to their brand at all times,” said Washcovick. “You can’t be everywhere, doing everything, and touching every end-user of your product or service, and reviews give you an opportunity to get an abundance of feedback.”</p>
<li>And increase conversions</li>
<p>More than half of consumers won’t use a business if it has less than a four-star rating. On the flip side, just a one-star increase in rating on Yelp can lead to a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue. </p>
<blockquote><p>Just a 1-star increase in rating on Yelp can lead to a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue.</p></blockquote>
<li>They also empower customers with information</li>
<p>Customer reviews are user-generated content about your business. Like a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/cultivate-community-customer-experience/">community forum</a> within a knowledge base, reviews can answer customers’ questions before they reach out to your support team by providing customers with insightful information. </p>
<p>“Customer reviews are a powerful tool for businesses to connect directly to people who want to know more about them. A customer can go to a restaurant’s Yelp page to get ideas of what to wear or what options are on the menu,” said Washcovick. “Customers want to search for more things online because they have access to so much information.”</ul>

<h3>How to tell if a review platform is legitimate or trustworthy</h3>
<p>Not every customer review site is created equal. Here are three key things to consider.</p>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-closed">
<h4>Does the review website go beyond ratings with quality content? </h4>
</div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p><a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/online-review-statistics/#gref" rel="noopener" target="_blank">73 percent</a> of consumers think written reviews are more important than ratings. </p>
<p>Quality review sites follow-up ratings with written explanations for context. “On Yelp, we want to know information, we aren’t just a star rating site,” said Washcovick.</p>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-closed">
<h4>Does it use a truth metric?</h4>
</div>
<div class="accordion-open">
<p>Context is key, but some review sites just want a lot of content whether it’s legitimate or not. That’s why it’s important to be aware if a review site measures content with a truth metric. </p>
<p>Yelp&#8217;s recommendation software looks at dozens of different signals, including various measures of quality, reliability, and activity on Yelp.</p>

<p>Technology creates a good user experience, but people keep a review site human. </p>
<p>In addition to automated software, Yelp allows businesses and consumers to report harmful or spammy reviews and has a team dedicated to reviewing all inbound flags.</p>
<p>“As a business owner, sometimes it’s appropriate to flag a review. We’re not going to let a customer go after an employee with demeaning language or an ex-employee bash a business in an aggressive way. Reviews are about helpful—not hurtful—content,” said Washcovick.</p>

<p><span id="How to ask customers for reviews"></p>
<h2>How to ask customers for reviews</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>The key to asking for reviews is to make it feel genuine. You don’t want to come across as spammy. Here are some tips:</p>
<h3>1. Meet customers where they are, on the channels of their choice</h3>
<p>The first step to increasing customer reviews is to make the experience as easy as possible. If a customer has to work hard to leave a review, they’ll likely give up. </p>
<p>Enabling customers to write reviews on the channels they prefer, and are already using, makes the review process more seamless. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include links to your Yelp page in your <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-through-social-media/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media</a> bio or newsletter footer.</li>
<li>If a customer reaches out on a messaging channel, they should be able to leave a review in the messaging thread so they don’t have to navigate outside of the experience. Likewise, if you&#8217;re communicating with a customer via email, they should be able to leave you a review in the body of the email.</li>
<li>If you have a mobile app, give customers the option to leave a review there as well as your website.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Follow-up on recent purchases or customer service interactions</h3>
<p>Automatically sending customers an email following-up on a recent purchase or customer service interaction is one of the most common ways businesses ask for reviews. </p>
<p>I recently bought a pair of flats from Birdies, and received a review request with 7 brief questions I could answer in the body of the email a week or so after my purchase.</p>
<p>Similarly, businesses can use <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/customer-service-management-software/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">customer service software</a> to send customers a satisfaction survey after a recent interaction, with an option to leave a customer service review. </p>
<h3>3. Leverage customer loyalty moments </h3>
<p>66 percent of loyal customers are likely to write a positive online review. </p>
<p>When customers demonstrate their loyalty, asking for a review feels more natural. You might ask a happy customer to write a review after: </p>
<ul>
<li>They refer a friend</li>
<li>They’ve been a customer for x amount of time or spent x amount of money with your business</li>
<li>They praise you publicly on social media</li>
</ul>
<p><b>But remember: it’s not authentic to only show flattering reviews, so a brand will want to make sure it’s not only asking for reviews from loyal customers.</b> </p>
<h3>4. Train customer advocate or service teams to ask for reviews</h3>
<p>Tain customer advocate or service teams to ask customers for reviews during the right moments, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a customer expresses appreciation for your brand</li>
<li>If a customer wants to provide feedback</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Offer incentives</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.powerreviews.com/blog/how-to-motivate-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> by PowerReviews found that more than half of consumers who aren’t writing reviews need more motivation to do so. This is where incentives like discounts or free company swag can help. </p>
<p>The frozen yogurt shop down the street from my apartment offered me a free yogurt to write a review—and I left one seconds later.</p>
<p>The key is to not ask customers to write a “good review” when offering an incentive so you don’t influence their response. </p>
<p><span id="How to get good reviews from customers"></p>
<h2>Strategies for getting positive customer reviews</h2>
<p></span><br />
Asking customers for reviews only goes so far. Companies with great customer reviews don’t necessarily have to ask for them—they do things regularly to create a review-worthy experience. </p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot of money or do something elaborate. More often than not, it’s little, everyday things, that stick with customers, like solving their issues quickly or proactively reaching out before a problem escalates. </p>
<p>Here are 8 strategies for how to get good reviews from customers:</p>
<h3>1. Listen to customers</h3>
<p>Getting positive reviews begins by listening to your customers’ needs and expectations. </p>
<p>Whether it’s a comment in a satisfaction survey, a common <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/discover-consumer-pain-points/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pain point</a> mentioned in your community forum, or something customers continuously tell agents directly, use the feedback to create a better experience. </p>
<p>For instance, Postmates’ CX team partners with their product team and analytics team to ensure customer feedback informs key product decisions.</p>
<h3>2. Actively engage customers</h3>
<p>If customers are engaged with your brand, they’ll be more motivated to write you a review. A few tried-and-true ways of engaging customers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building an online community where customers can engage with one another</li>
<li>Providing personalized service</li>
<li>Leveraging AI to create interactive experiences, such as through chatbots</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more customer engagement strategies in <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/strategies-increasing-customer-engagement/">our blog</a>. </p>
<h3>3. Show customers you appreciate them</h3>
<p>Feeling unappreciated is the <a href="https://www.vonage.com/resources/articles/the-62-billion-customer-service-scared-away-infographic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">number one</a> reason customers stop purchasing a product or service. But when customers do feel valued, they&#8217;re more likely to share their experience with others. </p>
<p>Here are a few ways to show customers you appreciate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create customer loyalty programs</li>
<li>Support social justice causes your customers care about</li>
<li>Surprise and delight customers with gifts</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-appreciation/">customer appreciation guide</a> for more tips. </p>
<h3>4. Share positive reviews</h3>
<p>Customers write reviews because they want to feel heard. When a business shares reviews in an email newsletter or on social media, they show customers that it cares about what they have to say. </p>
<p>“When companies share reviews, they show that this ecosystem of what customers say about their business matters, and that they’re proud of it,” said Washcovick. “This will naturally make other customers more included to share their experiences, too.”</p>
<h3>5. Deliver an excellent customer experience</h3>
<p>After having a positive experience with a company, <a href="https://www.xminstitute.com/blog/cx-leads-to-recommendations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">77 percent</a> of customers would recommend it to a friend.</p>
<p>The key to inspiring customers to leave a positive review is to deliver an excellent <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-companies-should-invest-in-the-customer-experience/">customer experience</a>, according to Washcovick. While it’s not a business’s job to turn every customer into a Yelp reviewer, it is their job to create a good experience. </p>
<p>“If a business leaves a great taste in customers’ mouths, they’ll be more likely to leave positive reviews,” Washcovick said. “As a customer, when you love something, you want to tell everyone so they can have that awesome experience, too.”</p>
<h3>6. Provide great customer service</h3>
<p>Customer service is a key piece in the customer experience puzzle. </p>
<p>Getting good reviews is about building relationships, which is a sweet spot where customer service can help. </p>
<blockquote><p>“Customer service makes a huge difference in a customer’s experience and willingness to talk about it because it adds a personal touch.”<cite>Emily Washcovick, Senior Field Marketing Manager, Yelp</cite></p></blockquote>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-10">
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<p>5 examples of businesses with good customer service reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zappos allows its Customer Loyalty Team to stay on customer calls for as long as they need to build relationships. It even allows customers to call or text the business about anything, whether they’re lonely on a Saturday night or are looking for Netflix recommendations</li>
<li>Nordstrom offers seamless returns—no questions asked. There&#8217;s an old story that it even let a customer return a tire.</li>
<li>Four Seasons Hotels &#038; Resorts provides personalized customer service via text message.</li>
<li>Warby Parker lets customers get help over the channels of their choice, including the phone, email, chat, or its knowledge base. </li>
<li>Birchbox uses service recovery to flag customer complaints and then turn the experience around to repair the relationship.</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<h3>7. Build a business around authenticity</h3>
<p>A review-worthy experience is an authentic one, according to Washcovick. </p>
<p>“The businesses we see get the most support on Yelp are the ones that are open and honest,” Washcovick said. </p>
<p>Authentic companies lead with transparency, use truth and emotion to tell their brand story, and operate with a conscience. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales being transparent about pricing</li>
<li>Marketing setting realistic expectations about the product or service</li>
<li>Customer service acknowledging when the business made a mistake</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Respond to reviews—even the negative ones</h3>
<p>Among consumers that read reviews, <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/#:~:text=A%20whopping%2097%25%20of%20review,part%20of%20the%20reviews%20process." rel="noopener" target="_blank">97 percent</a> read businesses’ responses to reviews. </p>
<p>“In addition to sharing reviews, businesses should also publicly respond to reviews. A potential customer will be more inclined to share their experience before they even have it when they know that business cares about their feedback,” said Washcovick.</p>
<p><span id="Responding to customer reviews"></p>
<h2>How to respond to negative reviews</h2>
<p></span></p>
<p>Negative reviews are inevitable. The key isn’t to lose sleep over them or try to take them down, but to use them to find some resolve. </p>
<p>“No one is perfect. Consumers even prefer to see some negative reviews,” said Washcovick. </p>
<p>In fact, when reviews appear to be too good to be true, consumers lose trust. </p>
<p>Customers want real feedback, and perfect reviews are a sign that they were written by bots—the Spiegel Research Center found that reviews in the 4.2 &#8211; 4.5 range are more likely to positively impact purchase decisions than five-star ratings. </p>
<blockquote><p>Reviews in the 4.2 &#8211; 4.5 range are more likely to positively impact purchase decisions than five-star ratings. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here are a few of Yelp’s tips for <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/DAsXCDkwwyTBBzQ1PIWZzO3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">responding to a negative review</a>: </p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Acknowledge the customer and thank them for sharing their experience</h4>
<p>“We recommend initially responding publicly to negative reviews, and in that public response to thank the customer for taking time to share their experience,” said Washcovick. “This demonstrates your customer service practices to potential customers.”</li>
<li>
<h4>Offer to have a private conversation</h4>
<p>After you acknowledge the complaint, your customer service team should send that customer a direct message to talk about how to resolve it in more detail. </p>
<p>Or, some businesses leave the ball in the customer’s court and provide a support email or phone number in their public response.</li>
<li>
<h4>Respond promptly</h4>
<p>Responses are strongest within 24 hours.</li>
<li>
<h4>Be empathetic</h4>
<p>“You have to be the professional one,” said Washcovick. “Take a deep breath and put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Get help from a teammate if you’re feeling emotional about it.”</li>
<li>
<h4>Try your best to resolve the issue</h4>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-customer-service-can-turn-angry-customers-into-loyal-ones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a> found that people who complained or wrote negative comments about a brand on social media and received a response were more loyal afterward than those who never complained at all. </p>
<p>“Not every reviewer is going to get back to you and give you the chance to resolve the issue. But if you can resolve it, it will go a long way,” said Washcovick. “That’s how you keep a customer.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Better reviews, better bottom-line</h2>
<p>How your customers think and feel about your business impacts your bottom-line. And when you create a great experience for your customer, they’ll want to share it with the world. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conventional understanding of the difference between leaders and managers held that a leader is a magnetic visionary who sets direction and inspires the best from people, while managers make sure everybody shows up on time, does their tasks, meets their deadlines, and follows the rules. Such narratives paint a leader as a superhero—Steve Jobs, Satya Nadella—and managers as gray functionaries; <a href="https://dilbert.com/search_results?terms=The%20Boss" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dilbert’s boss</a>. As Solu Nwanze, a leadership coach at <a href="https://www.expandedimpact.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Expanded Impact</a> and senior director of the office of the president, GTM at Zendesk, said: People think of managers as dealing with tasks, and leaders as dealing with people.</p>
<p>But these ideas hearken from an anachronistic work culture, when people showed up as their “work selves” and fulfilled occupational roles. Today, with COVID-19, employees are “bringing their whole selves to work” at an unprecedented level. Managers are charged with facilitating team discussions on issues like diversity, sexism, mental health, and personal meaning. They’re expected to engage with employees in a much deeper, more holistic way. In fact, when they do their jobs well, managers can end up doing a lot of things that leaders do, which makes them much better managers.  </p>
<h4>The definition of leadership, at any level, is changing</h4>
<p>Managers don’t always receive the kind of leadership training that corporate leaders often receive. But  many of the principles taught in leadership programs would really help, especially since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/09/21/how-bad-bosses-compel-good-employees-to-leave/#42633a395837" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a lot of employees leave a company because of bad managers</a>. For example, Nwanze noted, managers who really understand what makes their employees tick get better results and keep their teams around longer, since having a manager in your corner greatly improves the employee experience. </p>
<p>Nwanze trained as a leadership coach at <a href="https://coactive.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Co-Active Training Institute (CTI)</a>, an organization that believes everyone is, or can be, a leader—and also that there’s more than one leadership style. But one of the most important skills taught to leaders is the ability to see your own strengths and weaknesses, and to self-reflect, she said. Without that, people tend to unconsciously foist their biases, triggers, and habits on others, potentially threatening the team’s sense of psychological safety. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, when they do their jobs well, managers can end up doing a lot of things that leaders do, which makes them much better managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another key leadership skill managers need, Nwanze said, is the ability to approach situations with curiosity rather than assumptions. “It’s about being vulnerable, being grateful, having appreciation or gratitude for each other and also for ourselves. I always tell people ‘Be generous with yourself and with others&#8230;.’ It’s about appreciating the journey.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/6-behaviors-of-an-inclusive-leader/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Inclusive leadership has never been more imperative</a>]</em></p>
<div style="padding: 26px 40px; color: #3C3E3F; letter-spacing: 0.2px; background-color: #f8f8f7;">
<h4>3 key qualities of a leader</h4>
<p>Leaders aren’t necessarily born—many of us can grow into positions of leadership and thrive. Here are a few key behaviors of good leaders.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize your strengths, and your weaknesses.</strong> Self-reflection allows leaders to catch biases and triggers or bad habits that may negatively affect or influence others.</li>
<li><strong>Leave your assumptions at the door.</strong> Unless, of course, you’re assuming positive intent. Be open to learning and questioning what others think or how something came to be. There can often be many ways to arrive at a particular goal or destination.</li>
<li><strong>Advocate for and empower your team.</strong> The role of a leader is to listen and recognize how to lift those around them to achieve both shared and personal goals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>“Leaders know their team and are able to advocate on behalf of the team,” Nwanze said. They see the individuals and know their dreams. And they empower their employees to do what is needed to achieve those dreams. “Everyone wants to feel empowered,” she said. “Everyone is <a href="https://coactive.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creative, resourceful, and whole</a>, though we don’t always see each other that way.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/8-cognitive-biases-affect-manage-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">8 cognitive biases that affect how you manage your team</a>]</em></p>
<h4>A leader is a person, not a position</h4>
<p>For some leaders, the learning curve may be shorter than for others. Some people innately embody many of the skills and qualities required from a leader. For James Kerr, author, speaker, and founder of <a href="https://indispensable-consulting.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indispensable Consulting</a>, leadership often reveals itself in a person’s thought process. Leaders see and make connections others miss, he said in an interview, and possess a natural curiosity. </p>
<p>“There’s an assumption that leadership only happens at the senior level,” he said. “That’s not the case. It happens in the whole lifecycle of one’s career.” A leader is a person who can take disparate parts of a problem or process and combine them in new ways, possibly to take things in a new direction through breakthrough thinking and disruption. The leaders are the ones who—at every level—get others to participate and offer their best ideas. When looking for people to groom for leadership, it’s those things, not the titles that count, Kerr said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Nwanze noted, managers who really understand what makes their employees tick get better results and keep their teams around longer, since having a manager in your corner greatly improves the employee experience. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability to manage and the ability to lead require both certain innate skills or temperaments and specific training. Unfortunately, management is often treated as the default path forward for employees, so people who are stellar individual contributors are moved into management positions even if that’s not their area of strength. For those people, there should be some parallel course of advancement. But management and leadership should be left to those for whom helping others grow is a key strength.</p>

<h4>5 differences between leaders and managers—and how together they make it work</h4>
<p>A few years ago, Kerr <a href="https://www.inc.com/james-kerr/leading-v-managing-ten-important-distinctions-that-can-help-you-to-become-better.html#:~:text=Leadership%20inspires%20change%2C%20management%20manages,inspire%20people%20to%20follow%20them." rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote an article</a> listing some of the more nuanced differences between the roles of leader and manager. While managers must be leaders within their own right, his list (both quoted directly and sometimes paraphrased) helps break down some of the hierarchical goals and tasks that are often in place—and makes clear why leaders need great managers, and vice versa.  </p>
<p><strong>1. Leadership inspires change, management manages transformation.</strong> Leaders choose the next direction for evolution but managers have to help everyone on the team make the necessary adjustments. </p>
<p><strong>2. Leadership requires abstract thinking, management requires concrete data.</strong><br />
“Abstract thinking,” Kerr wrote, “enables a person to make connections among, and see patterns within, seemingly unrelated information.” The leader sees those connections and the manager uses concrete data to achieve optimal results moving toward the perceived goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leader is a person who can take disparate parts of a problem or process and combine them in new ways, possibly to take things in a new direction through breakthrough thinking and disruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Leadership requires ability to articulate, management requires ability to interpret.</strong><br />
“A good leader can describe their vision in vivid detail… a good manager must interpret that stated vision and recast it in terms that their teams can understand and embrace.”</p>
<p><strong>4. Leadership requires an aptitude to sell, management requires an aptitude to teach.</strong> “A leader must…convince all concerned parties that what is envisioned is achievable and provides greater value than what is created by the business today. A manager must be able to teach their teams what must be learned and adapted to attain the stated vision.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/informal-leadership-person-work-others-look/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Informal leadership: Be the person at work that others look up to</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Leadership requires understanding of the external environment, management requires understanding of how work gets done inside the organization.</strong> Leaders at the most senior level must understand the business environment in which the enterprise operates so as to better anticipate opportunities and evade misfortune, while a manager must figure out how to get things done using the resources available to the business.</p>
<p>Not every manager may aspire toward the highest levels of leadership, yet that doesn’t preclude them from becoming great leaders—for themselves, for their team, and for the business. As the world changes, so too may our ideas about leadership—perhaps revealing why cultivating leadership at every level of a company is what it takes to achieve the best results. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yazneiry, of the Bronx, NY, used her thousand dollars to pay bills and purchase school supplies for her youngest daughter.</p>
<p>Let go from her job as a bathroom attendant in Madison Square Garden in early March, Irma, mother of two, used the money for rent and bills.</p>
<p>The thousand dollars she received allowed Tiffanie of St. Paul, MN, to make her car and insurance payments so she and her children can continue to travel safely during the pandemic.</p>
<p>With many state economies shutting down in March due to the coronavirus, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/national-employment-monthly-update.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unemployment in the U.S.</a> jumped from 3.6 percent in January 2020 to 14.6 percent in April. The hardest hit were<br />
low-wage workers, a group disproportionally made up of people of color.</p>
<p>One of the many nonprofit organizations working to address this financial crisis is <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GiveDirectly</a>.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Provide direct relief" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/provide-direct-relief.png" /></p>
<h2>Providing direct relief to those who need it most</h2>
<p>Founded in 2009 to provide financial support to some of the poorest communities in Africa, GiveDirectly’s guiding philosophy is that people living in poverty deserve to choose for themselves how best to improve their lives. The nonprofit provides cash transfers directly to those in need from funds donated by private individuals, corporations, and foundations.</p>
<p>GiveDirectly’s first operations in the U.S. supported vulnerable people in the wake of natural disasters—in Houston due to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey and in Puerto Rico due to the devastation from Hurricane Maria.</p>
<p>In March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic forced communities across the country to go into lockdown, GiveDirectly launched a program called Project 100 to raise $100 million dollars in 100 days for American families whose circumstances had been affected by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The project was a huge new endeavor for GiveDirectly, with an ambitious goal: To identify 1,000 eligible families and distribute the $100M in three months.</p>
<p>In defining their program strategy, GiveDirectly quickly discovered they would need to send out as many as 15,000 to 20,000 payments per week to eligible recipients to meet their goal. Which meant the organization needed a help desk or customer service function to handle the inbound requests and questions around processing of those payments.</p>
<p>GiveDirectly’s leadership team found Zendesk through referrals and after briefly exploring other options applied for a sponsorship through our <a href="https://techforgood.zendesk.com/hc/en-us?_ga=2.37193504.1804295201.1599158184-1913883631.1591812682" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tech for Good</a> program. Once accepted, GiveDirectly built a Zendesk help center over a weekend, and through Zendesk Support, began receiving requests and sending out payments almost immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“I’ve been amazed by how quickly we were able to stand this up and have it really save a lot of time and effort and spin up the ability to send out payments as quickly as we did, up to 15,000 payments a week.”<br />
<cite>Max Nichols, Humanitarian Senior Manager at GiveDirectly</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Cash = choice" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/cash-equals-choice.png" /></p>
<h2>Cash = Choice</h2>
<p>When identifying families in need of cash assistance, GiveDirectly starts with Americans enrolled in <a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SNAP</a> (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), knowing them to be particularly vulnerable to begin with, and often the hardest hit by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Eligible individuals who are selected see the money appear in their bank account as an instant cash transfer, so they can spend it on whatever they need most, no strings attached.</p>
<p>To date, the organization has raised $117.2M of its now $200M goal, funding 115,000 U.S. families. When they reached their target $100M mark two weeks early, GiveDirectly decided to continue the project. On July 16, 2020, they launched Project 100 Plus with the goal of raising another $100M to help an additional 96,000 families.</p>
<p>The premise around cash transfers is at its core a philosophy of aid that prioritizes choice. GiveDirectly believes that they, as an aid organization, should not presume what people living in poverty need or dictate how aid is used:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Traditional aid models</th>
<th>GiveDirectly</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Send canned goods, clothes, or things that <em>donors</em> think the recipient needs</td>
<td>Trusts recipients to use the money they receive as they see fit</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<p>GiveDirectly&#8217;s <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research</a> makes a strong case that their approach yields much better outcomes. Data and follow-up from recipients illustrates what the money is doing for families, how essential it is to their survival, and how vital the timing was.</p>
<p>Recipients of GiveDirectly’s $1,000 cash donations have used the money for:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>Rent, insurance, and mortgage payments</li>
<li>Laptops for remote learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Two-thirds of Project 100 recipients report that the cash allowed them to keep their home by allowing them to pay their rent or mortgage, and 40 percent report that the cash allowed them to avoid debt by paying bills. Nearly all—98 percent—reported that they preferred a cash grant over anything they would have received in material donations.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Data reveals gaps" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/data-reveals-gaps.png" /></p>
<h2>Data reveals gaps in the recipient experience</h2>
<p>Nichols explains the impact that Zendesk tools, and specifically Zendesk Explore, have had:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s huge—Explore has allowed us to iteratively improve as we go. I’m doing a weekly tracking of major stats, number of tickets, number of one-touch tickets…”<br />
<cite>Max Nichols, Humanitarian Senior Manager at GiveDirectly</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Analyzing data captured with Explore, GiveDirectly noticed that a lot of Spanish speakers were dropping off part way through the customer support pipeline because instructions were only offered in English. That insight prompted the org to add a Spanish option, allowing them to reach many more program recipients. That process upgrade “would have been impossible to identify without the analytics through Explore.”</p>
<p>GiveDirectly will continue running its Project 100 Plus program for as long as there is a need, assuming it has the necessary funds to disperse.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“We all thought this would be three or four months, but we see from the interest and need that we’ll be running this program for the foreseeable future.”<br />
<cite>Ashley Beale, Communications Manager at GiveDirectly</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>With over 100,000 families already funded, you can <a href="https://donate.givedirectly.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join the movement</a> to give cash relief to U.S. households impacted by COVID-19.</em></p>

		<title>3 hidden costs of Freshdesk: Why low license fees can be deceptive</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing a customer service solution, there are many factors to consider, and let’s face it — cost is high among them. Freshdesk says you’re saving money on their low license costs, which is a part of the total cost of ownership, but there are big trade offs to know about. Here are the top three things you should consider.</p>
<h2> 1: Freshdesk’s spotty reliability can tarnish your brand</h2>
<p>Your customers and your support teams depend on your software to work for them. So when it’s not reliable, it can cost you time and money. Dropped chats and calls lead to frustrated customers and agents. According to the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer-experience-trends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report,</a> roughly half of customers say they would switch to a competitor after just one bad experience. That number snowballs to 80% after more than one. So, failing to meet your customer’s needs can come at a high cost. </p>
<p><strong>Zendesk is built to be reliable</strong><br />
Our customers, like Airbnb, Slack, Zoom, and Shopify, have a wide variety of sophisticated support needs. Having a reliable solution means you don’t have to spend valuable time worrying about software issues and dropped calls. Instead of investing resources in fixing reliability problems, you can focus on your customers and your business. And that gives you the ability to provide a better customer experience. </p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/monese/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Monese</a> had reliability challenges with Freshdesk, a major reason for their switch to Zendesk</h3>
<p>The fintech company provides a banking app that makes it easier to get settled in a new country. And banking from anywhere requires customer service everywhere. When the company was just getting started, it used Freshdesk to handle voice and email contacts. But it quickly became clear that the company needed to centralize contacts into a single solution. Freshdesk’s spotty voice service, combined with other integration issues, left Monese unsatisfied.</p>
<p>“We were having some difficulties with the Freshdesk call side,” explained Lauri Haav, Monese’s head of Customer Loyalty. “We had massive problems with call drops, mixed calls — calls would just mysteriously disappear, never actually reaching the agents. The Freshdesk voice product wasn’t good enough for us.” —Lauri Haav, Monese’s head of Customer Loyalty</p>
<p><strong>After switching to Zendesk, Monese saw its CSAT increase by 10 percentage points, and its overall response time decrease by 59 percent.</strong></div>
<h2>2. Freshdesk’s agent interface is inefficient and creates poor CX</h2>
<p>In Freshdesk, agents have to toggle between multiple browser tabs and applications to access what they need to resolve issues, creating a “swivel-chair” experience. </p>
<p>On top of that, in Freshdesk, agents have to learn three different interfaces for omnichannel service: Freshdesk for email and web submissions, Freshchat for chat and social messaging, and Freshcaller for telephony. All those systems take more time from your team &#8211; time that could instead be spent creating great customer experiences.</p>
<p>With different customer profiles across Freshdesk, Freshchat and Freshcaller, agents have to hunt for what they need to help customers, leading to confusion and frustration, and longer reply times and resolutions times for customers and agents alike. And when customers aren’t happy with your service, they aren’t likely to keep doing business with you. That’s a hidden cost that can compound rapidly over time. </p>
<p><strong>Zendesk gives your agents all the tools they need in one seamless interface</strong><br />
With Zendesk, everything is one place. Instead of having to use multiple tabs and apps, we give your agents a unified customer view with ticket fields, macros, sidebar apps, and more. We bring it all together in one customer profile, with a history of communications between your company and the customer for the agent, no matter the channel. This gives agents the context they need to personalize each customer’s experience. </p>
<p>And Zendesk cuts down on training time, too. Instead of learning multiple systems, Zendesk agents only need to train on one omnichannel interface that’s loaded with one set of customer data and tools. Having the same tools and customer profile, regardless of channel, allows your agents to focus on servicing the customer, instead of scrambling for tools and data across various applications. As a result, agents are able to respond faster to customers and resolve issues more quickly, resulting in a better CX.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/showpo/">Showpo </a>switched to Zendesk because Freshdesk’s multiple interfaces were frustrating.</h3>
<p>The fashion retailer found that achieving and maintaining fast resolution times was difficult with Freshdesk. Showpo struggled to offer timely and effective service with Freshdesk, due to its heavily fragmented and disjointed agent experience. Agents often wasted time scrambling for tools and data across a multitude of browser tabs, resulting in longer reply and resolution times, and a poor CX. </p>
<p>“When we were on Freshdesk, an agent would have eight, nine, ten different tabs open—DHL, Australia Post, Magento, all these different tabs,” Waddy said. “Our goal is to integrate those into Zendesk.”- Paul Waddy, Head of Operations</p>
<p><strong>After switching to Zendesk, Showpo was able to integrate everything into one unified omnichannel agent experience, resulting in massive efficiency gains. </strong>For example, Showpo’s agents now answer chats within 26 seconds, 4 seconds faster than their original KPI.</div>
<h2>3: Freshdesk’s one-size-fits-all reporting doesn’t give you the deep insights you need to optimize your business.</h2>
<p>More and more, businesses are setting themselves apart with great customer experiences. In order to create a unique and outstanding customer experience, you need to be able to dig deeper into your data to make better decisions and optimize. If you don’t have the necessary insight to differentiate with your customer experience, chances are, customers won’t see the benefit of doing business with you and they’ll likely leave for a competitor.</p>
<h3>Zendesk’s advanced reporting capabilities help you harness your customer data</h3>
<p>Our customers say they love our superb out-of-the-box analytic capabilities, because better insights helps them make better business decisions. With Zendesk, you&#8217;ll have the data you need to identify trends quickly and make better decisions to optimize your operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified reporting </strong>on all channels across the platform in one consolidated analytics tool</li>
<li><strong>Create custom metrics</strong>\ unique to your business for better decision-making</li>
<li><strong>Visualization capabilities</strong> like easy-to-use reports and dashboards help you quickly identify what’s working and what isn’t so you can change course</li>
<li><strong>Data discovery</strong> means you don’t have to export to excel spreadsheets and manually dig through data, saving you time and effort</li>
</ul>
<p>A great example of this is Zendesk’s First Reply Time Heatmap. In a matter of minutes, you can build a report that combines 2 datasets (FRT by hour of the day and FRT day of the week) in a compelling visualization that’s easily digestible, allowing you to quickly identify when to staff more or less agents and/or optimize processes to improve reply times.</p>
<p><img src="https://zen-marketing-content.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/Explore_recipe_8.png"/></p>
<p>Try building the same or similar report in Freshdesk. Spoiler alert: you can’t!</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/thinkific/">Thinkific </a>had to manually track agent productivity in a spreadsheet with Freshdesk &#8211; which was counterproductive.</h3>
<p>On top of that, the company discovered Freshdesk, had reporting, reliability, and search functionality limitations that were causing widespread agent frustration. Agents had to use an interface so glitchy, they often had to clear the browser cache, leading to lost time and lower productivity.</p>
<p>“Not too long ago, agent productivity tracking at Thinkific involved manually loading response times into a spreadsheet… ‘[Zendesk] Explore has been awesome from a reporting standpoint. We have so much of what we need available for us to be able to build reports.’”<br />
&#8211; Project Manager, Katerina Graham</p>
<p><strong>After switching to Zendesk, Thinkific calculated the return on investment (ROI) by determining that agents could resolve 2.5 more tickets per day, which translates to one less headcount.</strong></div>
<h2>Look at all the costs associated with Freshdesk</h2>
<p>The tradeoffs of choosing a customer service solution that promises “low license costs” can have a huge impact on your business. Although Freshdesk promises low cost, license cost alone doesn’t encompass the total cost of ownership. As you incur costs with Freshdesk because of nascent infrastructure, fragmented interface, and far too basic reporting, the “savings” on licensing begin to evaporate. Make sure you know all of the hidden costs &#8211; and learn what you might be missing out on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we continue to navigate the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesks-benchmark-snapshot-impact-covid-19-cx/">impacts of COVID-19</a>, businesses and customers alike are recognizing that knowledge is power. Information, resources and instructions—the kind of knowledge typically provided on company help centers and FAQ pages—can help keep the world moving even when so much remains unknown.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for sure is that the world will keep changing, and no matter what happens, you’ll need to keep your customers informed. Read on to see how a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/knowledge-management-system/">knowledge management</a> system can help. </p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Disseminate important information quickly</h4>
<p>When a crisis strikes, you need to be able to communicate important information and updates with your customers and stakeholders. That is especially true in a situation like COVID-19, where wrong information can put people’s health at risk. Fluyt, a Colombian-based design, communication, and education consultancy, recognized that knowledge is power—the power to save lives. They sought to create an online resource where people could find reliable information without waiting on phone support lines, which were facing high call volumes due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>But as they quickly realized, a crisis is not the time to start building an app or website from scratch. They turned to Zendesk’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-tech-good-participants-create-crucial-covid-19-resources/">Tech for Good</a> program and soon launched the masuno.app, a content hub built with Zendesk Guide. Since its debut, 40+ volunteers have helped design, draft, and publish over 200 articles on everything from mental health to spotlights on nonprofits actively addressing the crisis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Help customers before they contact support</h4>
<p>A knowledge management solution can also help you stay on top of surging customer service requests, as many companies experienced in the first few months of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/customer/discords-covid-19-response/">Discord</a>, a free service that makes it easy for groups to communicate over voice, video, and text, saw their usage triple following shelter-in-place rules. Thanks in part to their investment in Zendesk’s self service tools, they were able to handle those requests swiftly and with less effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We know that we cannot scale without having some self service solution, so we invest so much into it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With so many first-time users arriving on their platform, self service has helped Discord by allowing them to deflect (or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/self-service-decrease-ticket-volume/">intercept</a>) some of the most commonly asked questions their agents receive, according to Danny Duong, Director of Customer Experience and Community Management at Discord. Providing this information through self service, or automating conversations with Answer Bot, allows his team to remain efficient while still helping customers find the information they need.</p>
<p>“We know that we cannot scale without having some self service solution, so we invest so much into it,” Duong says. “If we can eliminate any of the tedious busywork when we can, we&#8217;re going to invest in it 100 percent.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Be responsive to customers’ changing habits</h4>
<p>Customers&#8217; needs often change, in crisis times or not. The support team at Khan Academy, an online learning platform, is accustomed to ebbs and flows in customer service requests driven by the academic calendar, but in the wake of COVID-19, they’ve experienced drastic spikes in usage. They saw a 1,200 percent increase in customer service ticket volume from parents and a 750 percent increase in ticket volume from teachers. Meanwhile, total learning time on the platform increased 150 percent year over year. </p>
<p>Fortunately, their team was prepared with a knowledge base and community forum, even welcoming their community members to answer support questions directly via Gather. In response to the crisis, they extended their resource offerings and doubled their outsourced support team. With these flexible self service solutions in place, they can be even more adaptable to customers changing needs and an ever-changing world.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Knowledge is power</h2>
<p>Knowledge is power, and customers will remember the companies who empowered them during these difficult times; who provided reliable, easy-to-access information; who helped them and supported them instead of simply trying to deflect them. Those companies will be best positioned to thrive in the months and years to follow. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of SaaS sales. Who&rsquo;s driving those purchases? SaaS sales reps.</p>

<blockquote><p>
By 2026, the SaaS market is expected to reach $307 billion.
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you&rsquo;re coming from a more traditional sales background, transitioning to SaaS can be a tricky adjustment. Sales reps need to understand the unique SaaS sales process and the best techniques for guiding a prospect to a purchase and beyond.</p>
<h2>What is SaaS sales?</h2>
<p>SaaS sales is the process of selling web-based software. With SaaS software, a service provider hosts the application at a data center, and customers access it via the internet. This saves clients the cost of maintaining the hardware needed to run traditional software and gives providers a steady stream of subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Anyone new to the SaaS sales rep role must learn how to pitch, demonstrate, and answer questions about highly technical products. You&rsquo;ll also have to get used to a subscription-based business model that relies heavily on retaining customers and upselling existing accounts. And because most SaaS products are significant investments, you&rsquo;ll have to adjust to a long sales cycle.</p>
<h2>The 5 stages of the SaaS sales funnel</h2>
<p>SaaS buyers typically need a fair amount of convincing before converting since software is often expensive. To guide a prospect, you need to recognize what stage of the buyer&rsquo;s journey they&rsquo;re at and how you can nudge them to the next step.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="SaaS sales funnel stages" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/saas-sales-funnel-stages.png" /></p>
<h3>Awareness</h3>
<p>The buyer&rsquo;s journey begins when a person first learns about your product. SaaS companies often try to get on a consumer&rsquo;s radar through inbound marketing methods, such as social media and gated content.</p>
<p>SaaS sales reps can also spread brand awareness by contacting potential leads. Cold calling, email outreach, and free trial offers are all common ways of reaching buyers for the first time.</p>
<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>This is the moment a buyer actually becomes curious about your product. The instant a promising lead interacts with your marketing signifies interest. That could be downloading a PDF from your site or visiting a certain landing page.</p>
<p>If the interest is sufficiently high, the lead could become <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/best-lead-scoring-models-7-factors/">a marketing qualified lead (MQL)</a> and get referred to a sales rep. For example, signing up for a free trial of your product automatically qualifies someone as an MQL.</p>
<p>Your job at this stage is to stoke a prospect&rsquo;s interest by educating them about your brand. You&rsquo;ll need a deep knowledge of your product and its competitors, and full command of common FAQs.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>A prospect enters the evaluation stage when they&rsquo;re actively considering a purchase. Nudge them in the right direction by answering any questions they have and addressing their unique pain points.</p>
<p>Show the prospect how your product can solve their needs with a private demonstration or a relevant case study. Be prepared to respond to objections they may have about the price or capability of the software. You need to know going into the negotiation if you&rsquo;re willing to offer a discount, and what other options&mdash;like a lower subscription tier&mdash;you might suggest first.</p>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>The prospect is close to making a purchase, but they still need a bit more time to mull it over. At this stage, it&rsquo;s critical that you keep them engaged.</p>
<p>Keep talking to the prospect and asking questions to keep the relationship alive. If they go silent, don&rsquo;t wait too long to send a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-emails/">follow-up email</a> or make another call. The SaaS market is competitive, and there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;re entertaining other offers.</p>
<h3>Purchase</h3>
<p>Finally&mdash;you&rsquo;ve reached the moment when the prospect says yes, and the deal is done. While this may be the final stage of the buyer&rsquo;s journey, it&rsquo;s not the end of the road for SaaS sales reps.</p>
<p>SaaS companies rely heavily on retention. They require a relatively steady (if not growing) recurring revenue since new sales take a long time to complete and can be hard to come by. After the purchase, continue to nurture client relationships to minimize churn.</p>
<h3>An example of the 5-stage SaaS sales funnel</h3>
<p>Just to make the process a little less abstract, here&rsquo;s an example of how the sales funnel might play out for a company that provides <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/support/features/customer-service-management-software/">customer support software</a>&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call them &ldquo;Company X&rdquo; (&ldquo;Company Z&rdquo; might be too on the nose&mldr;)</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Interest: </strong>Impressed, she visits the Company X website and reads about their software. Interested, she downloads a free demo. A sales rep at Company X is notified the moment the free trial begins, and he quickly sends her an email introducing himself and offering to help her set up the software.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The prospect has been testing out the software for a few days, but hasn&rsquo;t made up her mind. She agrees to get on a call with the sales rep so he can answer a few questions she has about the service.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The trial period is coming to a close, but no deal has been made. The sales rep emails the prospect to remind her that the demo is expiring, then emails her again when she doesn&rsquo;t respond within two days.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase:</strong> The prospect finally gets back to the sales rep to express her company&rsquo;s interest in the software. They set up a meeting with some of the company&rsquo;s other stakeholders and hammer out the details of the agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after the deal&rsquo;s done, the rep will want to stay in touch with the customer and keep an eye out for potential <a href="https://blog.getbase.com/3-tips-drive-upsells">upselling opportunities</a> further down the road. The best SaaS businesses are able to expand by <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/turn-churn-around-reduce-customer-churn/">holding onto old customers</a> while also winning new ones.</p>
<h2>6 sales techniques to convert more SaaS leads</h2>
<p>Understanding the process is the first step, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://360learning.com/blog/sales-training-strategy-google-mastersaas/">mastering it</a> is the second (considerably longer) step. Here are some tips and tricks to get you started qualifying, engaging, and converting prospects.</p>
<h3>1. Know the product inside and out</h3>
<p>Be prepared for technical questions&mdash;you&rsquo;re going to get a lot of them! Talk to your company&rsquo;s product marketers and spend time using the software so you&rsquo;re aware of new add-ons and feature rollouts.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re facing especially challenging questions from a lead, don&rsquo;t be afraid to call for backup. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to bring engineers or product managers into SaaS sales meetings to help land a deal.</p>
<h3>2. Be persistent</h3>
<p>Be extremely dogged in your pursuit of prospects. A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blog.topohq.com/sales-development-technology-the-stack-emerges/">TOPO study</a> found that it takes 18 or more phone calls to connect with a potential buyer.</p>
<p>Most SaaS sales reps make dozens of calls a day. The fewer answers you get, the more discouraging it feels. But don&rsquo;t let that stop you. If you consistently reach out to leads, you&rsquo;ll eventually see engagement.</p>
<h3>3. Set up an email drip campaign</h3>
<p>To nurture leads, consider sending an email drip campaign to people who have expressed interest in your business. These campaigns tend to drive click-through rates and keep prospects from forgetting about you.</p>
<p>You might set up a drip campaign for people who download your company&rsquo;s ebook. After the download, the person receives six weeks of educational emails about your product.</p>
<p>Or, build a drip campaign for people who sign up for a free trial. These campaigns should provide prospects with resources that can help them get the most value out of your product.</p>
<h3>4. Call prospects as soon as they sign up</h3>
<p>Signing up for a free trial is the biggest indicator that someone&rsquo;s interested in your product. Call <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.close.com/why-you-need-to-call-every-signup-user-within-5/">within the first five minutes</a> of their sign-up to make a friendly introduction. Thank them for their interest, and offer to answer any questions they have. The faster you call, the more likely you are to get them on the phone.</p>
<p>Calling right away gives you the opportunity to offer a live setup call. Offering that sort of personalized support right out of the gate is a great way to convert leads.</p>
<h3>5. Offer short product demos</h3>
<p>Qualify and research your lead before offering them a product demonstration. You need to understand how your product will specifically help them before you can show off its benefits. Keep one-on-one demos short&mdash;around 15 minutes or so&mdash;to respect prospects&rsquo; time, and leave plenty of room for questions.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
Limit one-on-one demos to 15 minutes or so to respect prospects’ time
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sales reps who have many engaged prospects sometimes offer &ldquo;one-to-many&rdquo; demos. These are like a webinar, but for a small group of similar buyers. &ldquo;One-to-many&rdquo; demos are good for prospects who want an overview of the product but don&rsquo;t want to speak directly with a sales rep.</p>
<h3>6. Identify upsell opportunities</h3>
<p>In the world of SaaS, a successful sale lays the groundwork for future sales. Once a customer makes a purchase, continue to check in on them to gauge when they might be ready for an upgrade.</p>
<p>With SaaS products, you can analyze customer behavior to identify upselling opportunities. For example, you might check to see if a customer is getting close to their account usage limits. If they are, reach out to ask if they&rsquo;re interested in an expanded plan.</p>
<p>Subscription services take time to become successful, so be patient. Focusing on building relationships with existing customers is crucial in the early stages of any SaaS business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve put in the work to build an excellent call center. You&#8217;ve hired for the right <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/call-center-skills/">skills</a>, given everyone the best possible <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/call-center-training-tips-for-building-a-team-of-agents/">training</a>, started <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/call-center-metrics-really-focus/">tracking your performance</a>, and you&#8217;ve even created a wonderful workplace where your agents can work and collaborate.</p>
<p>Then 2020 happened. The COVID-19 pandemic closed offices and sent employees home. As the days away from the office added up, returning to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; in your call center anytime soon seemed less and less likely.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, you&#8217;re not alone. The good news is, your customer service team can still field calls and take care of customers without sharing the same office&mdash;or any office at all.</p>
<p>The era of the virtual call center is upon us.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is a virtual call center?</h2>
<p>A customer service call center where the support agents can take phone calls from multiple locations. Whether working from home or in several different offices, agents might be physically separated but they&#8217;re digitally connected via <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/features/virtual-call-center/">virtual call center software</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Virtual call centers were originally designed to support customers in various time zones and help companies save money on central office overhead costs.</p>
<p>Recent events have made them far more common&mdash;and it seems like things are going to stay that way.</p>
<ul>
<li>In April, a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-05-11-gartner-says-customer-service-and-support-leaders-mus">Gartner survey</a> of 59 customer service and support leaders found that 80% planned to increase work-from-home (WFH) programs as a result of the pandemic</li>
<li>Another recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.speechmatics.com/product/gartner-report/">Gartner report</a> predicted that by 2023, over one-third of the customer service workload would be done from home&mdash;up from just 5% in 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID-19 accelerated the switch to virtual call centers, but it turns out they were already on the way to becoming commonplace.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re taking temporary work-from-home precautions due to coronavirus or making a permanent change, it&rsquo;s worth learning how to start a virtual call center. Knowing the best way to go remote will help prepare you for the not-so-distant future of customer service.</p>
<h2>Understand the trade-offs</h2>
<p>Both traditional and virtual call centers have their unique advantages. It&rsquo;s important to understand what you&rsquo;re losing&mdash;and what you&rsquo;re gaining&mdash;when you make the switch.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that having everyone in the same office space makes certain tasks simpler. Some of the biggest benefits of a brick-and-mortar call center include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More opportunities for customer service agents to interact with each other</li>
<li>Fewer security risks and administrative burdens when everyone&rsquo;s in the same location</li>
<li>Easier for managers to monitor and motivate employees</li>
</ul>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h5>Counterpoints:</h5>
<ul>
<li>You can mitigate some of the security risks associated with virtual call centers by using VPNs. These can help reduce the likelihood of cyberattacks and breaches.</li>
<li>Secure virtual meeting platforms can help replace in-person management tactics like &ldquo;walking the floor&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/features/virtual-call-center/">virtual call centers</a> also offer a lot of their own operational and personal advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More freedom and flexibility for employees in a WFH environment</li>
<li>Fewer overhead costs and expenses</li>
<li>Ability to hire from a wider talent pool</li>
<li>Easier to provide round-the-clock support when using distributed teams in multiple time zones</li>
</ul>
<p>While you may lose some of the interpersonal advantages of an office space, there are ways to help correct for that.</p>
<p>One of the biggest is hiring the type of employees who excel in remote work environments.</p>
<h2>Hire and train for a remote workplace</h2>
<p>Almost anyone with a decent internet connection can telecommute. Sounds great, right? After all, that means you have a candidate pool of about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20use%20the,percent%20of%20the%20global%20population.">4.5 billion people</a>.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: not everyone who <em>can</em> work remotely <em>should</em> work remotely. Working from home productively <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/successfully-build-manage-virtual-teams/">requires a certain level</a> of focus and self-discipline.</p>
<p>When hiring customer support agents for a virtual call center, look for candidates who:</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Can self-manage and work independently</li>
<li>Are skilled in written and verbal communication</li>
<li>Perform well under a low-touch, high-flexibility management style</li>
<li>Aren&rsquo;t afraid to proactively ask questions when they&rsquo;re unsure of something</li>
</ul>
<p>To effectively train new hires from afar, you&rsquo;ll need to create a comprehensive set of easily accessible onboarding materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create resources to explain all of the tools, policies, and procedures that agents need to know. A <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/5-knowledge-base-design-best-practices/">digital knowledge base</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vyond.com/resources/importance-video-animation-remote-training/#:~:text=Video%20and%20animation%20can%20make%20complex%20topics%20easier%20to%20understand,'re%20learning%2C%20and%20more.">video training documents</a> are great ways to do this.</li>
<li>Use video conferencing and screen sharing to walk agents through the essential functions of their position. (Be sure to record these sessions so they can be used to help train others.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Set up weekly one-on-one meetings with new agents, using video chats to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.charthop.com/blog/best-practices/managing-remote-employees/">track how they&rsquo;re feeling</a> over time. It&rsquo;s also important to maintain an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy so employees know they can come to you whenever they have questions or concerns&mdash;not just during scheduled meetings.</p>
<h2>Give agents the tools they need to succeed</h2>
<p>No longer needing a central office space can dramatically reduce overhead costs. On the flip side, you may need to invest in some new technologies to facilitate a virtual call center.</p>
<p>During COVID-19, that&rsquo;s been a challenge for some companies. Take the example of T-Mobile. Like many companies, they <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cio.com/article/3561588/covid-19-crisis-accelerates-rise-of-virtual-call-centers.html">sent their 12,000 customer support employees</a> home to work in the midst of the pandemic. This meant a team of IT staffers had to dismantle call center offices, sanitize equipment, and mail it to their support agents&rsquo; homes.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
At a minimum, agents need a good computer, a softphone, and a good-quality headset.
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Going remote isn&rsquo;t always such a massive undertaking. But you do need to work hard to ensure your agents have the necessary call center hardware and software. At a minimum, agents working from home need a good computer or laptop with the latest operating system, a softphone, and a good-quality headset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to create a checklist for all of the IT equipment you&rsquo;ll need to provide to your support agents. You&#8217;ll want to include items like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company-issued laptop loaded with all of the apps your business needs to work</li>
<li>Charging cord/cable/base</li>
<li>External keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>Any dongles necessary for setup</li>
<li>Privacy screen</li>
<li>Headset for calls and videoconferences</li>
<li>Two factor authentication (2FA) device (phone, YubiKey, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote agents, of course, also need to be able to use these tools when they arrive. At Zendesk, we require that all of our work-from-home employees have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable high-speed internet access with appropriate bandwidth (10Mbps)</li>
<li>A quiet space for conducting internal and external calls</li>
<li>At least a semi-private layout where their screen is not visible to others</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual call centers also rely on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology, which allows users to make voice calls via a broadband Internet connection rather than analog phone lines. You&rsquo;ll want a VoIP that&rsquo;s easy to configure and manage, such as <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/">Zendesk Talk</a>.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Why choose Zendesk Talk for your virtual call center?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to configure and manage</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s cloud-based, so support agents with solid internet connections and headsets can use Talk anywhere in the world</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also considerably cheaper than traditional landlines, which take longer to install and have more limited capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk">Learn more about Zendesk Talk</a></p>
</div>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the technology, you can start taking calls immediately with a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/register/?source=zendesk_talk#step-1">free trial of Zendesk Talk</a>. Users can also connect the call center software of their choice to Zendesk with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/talk-partner-edition/#talk-partner-edition">Talk Partner Edition</a>.</p>
<h2>Navigate the challenges of managing remotely</h2>
<p>Leading a virtual call center poses unique challenges for customer support team managers. When you&rsquo;re not in a shared physical space, seeing the same people every day, you have to go out of your way to maintain relationships.</p>
<p>One of your biggest responsibilities is fostering collaboration and communication across physical barriers. Here are a few ways you can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule regular team meetings at times that fit your employees&rsquo; time zones. You can conduct them with tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/">GoToMeeting</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>.</li>
<li>Take advantage of other collaborative tools. For example, you can set up a designated team <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channel or a shared <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> board for tracking projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>When team members are working all by their lonesome, it&rsquo;s more important than ever to regularly have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vitally.io/blog/posts/four-tips-from-the-experts-to-lead-your-customer-success-team-remotely/">friendly, non-work-related interactions</a> with them. Occasionally message an employee to see how they&rsquo;re doing or offer to grab a virtual cup of coffee with them. Host virtual happy hours or water cooler sessions that give everyone a chance to talk about something other than work.</p>
<p>Of course, you also need to keep an eye on productivity levels and customer service quality. And it&rsquo;s not always easy to monitor performance and help agents improve from a distance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re used to coaching in person, though, there are ways to adapt virtually. T-Mobile&rsquo;s support team, for example, moved to call coaching via collaboration tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.webex.com/">WebEx</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a> after going remote. They&rsquo;ve also created a special Slack channel where reps can message coaches for help.</p>
<h2>Learn how to start a virtual call center to prepare for the future</h2>
<p>If COVID-19 forced you to transition to a virtual call center, you&rsquo;ve probably had to make some major adjustments under a great deal of stress.</p>
<p>The good news is, it was well worth the effort. By enabling your team to work from home, you&rsquo;ve set them up for long-term success as the future of work becomes increasingly remote.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Employees have embraced remote work</h3>
<p>According to Buffer&rsquo;s 2020 State of Remote Work Report, a full <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020">98% of remote workers</a> say they&rsquo;d like to continue to work remotely (at least some of the time) for the rest of their careers.</p>
</div>
<p>A significant portion of the workforce won&rsquo;t ever be going back into the office. That&#8217;s partly due to how much happier and more productive they are outside of it.</p>
<p>Listen to the trends and empower your team to do their best work in their most comfortable environment&mdash;their home. You&rsquo;ll have a lot of happy support agents serving a lot of satisfied customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building a great product isn&rsquo;t enough to stand out in the market. What you need is a compelling message&mdash;one that speaks to your audience and is unique to your brand.</p>
<p>How do you make sure you&rsquo;re telling the same story to every customer across every touchpoint? One key tactic is writing a positioning statement.</p>
<h2>What is a positioning statement?</h2>
<p>A positioning statement describes your product and target audience and explains how it fills a market need.</p>
<p>Marketing and sales teams use this statement to guide their messaging and make sure all communication is consistent.</p>
<p>A position statement is sometimes confused with mission statements and value propositions, but there are a few key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positioning Statement:</strong> Used to align messaging on internal teams, though a good positioning statement is often versatile enough to use externally, too. Describes a product and its target consumer and explains how it fills a need in a different way than its competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Explains what benefits your product provides to your customers. The value proposition is often used as part of the positioning statement.</li>
<li><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Public-facing tagline or statement identifying your brand strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure how to write a brand positioning statement? Start by reading successful positioning statement examples from other companies to get ideas for writing your own.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millennials get a lot of flack for coming into the workplace and asking for more. They want <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/bring-humanity-to-work/">more humanity at work</a>, <a href="https://relate.zendesk.com/articles/needy-millennials-want-hugs-emotional-leadership/">more emotional connection</a>, and more work-life balance. More, more, more. Turns out, Millennials still <em>need</em> more. They need more friends.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/content-center/news/over-90-young-workers-having-difficulty-working-home-survey-finds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey by Smartsheet</a> found that “95% of Generation Z and 93% of Millennial workers report difficulty working from home as a result of COVID-19,” which is more than any other age group. Shelter-in-place orders have left many of us feeling isolated, but it would be easy to assume the younger, tech-savvy generations would feel less affected than older generations. Turns out: Millennials and Gen Z are the loneliest.</p>
<h4>Millennials have broken social networks</h4>
<p>Millennials feeling lonely isn’t new, but the pandemic has certainly shoved our loneliness in our faces. Working from home without the ability to socialize in person and missing out on watercooler talk with co-workers has shown Millennials just how lonely they are.</p>
<p>Why are Millennials so lonely? There are a few reasons.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/pivot-in-the-face-of-change/">How to pivot in the face of change</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>Living alone</strong><br />
Millennials and Gen Z are hitting adult milestones later in life than their older peers. They’re <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/millennials-redefining-marriage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waiting to get married</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2020/05/01/new-study-millennial-women-are-delaying-having-children-due-to-their-careers/#72fc1364276a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">having children when they’re older</a>. This waiting to settle down means that some Millennials and Gen Zers are living alone, though <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many in the U.S. are living with their parents</a>—and now also working remotely, without the social outlets they once enjoyed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working from home without the ability to socialize in person and missing out on watercooler talk with co-workers has shown Millennials just how lonely they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mobility creates broken social networks</strong><br />
Another major factor in why younger people are more lonely is that they’re more likely to have recently moved. While technology makes it easier to stay connected, we still tend to have a proximity bias when it comes to making friends. As social creatures, we like to gather face-to-face and have impromptu hangouts. After college, many people move to new cities to pursue opportunities. This move can break existing social ties with family and friends. Making friends in a new city, especially dense cities, can be difficult. </p>
<p>Not only does moving break existing social networks, but there’s also a <a href="https://www.socialconnectedness.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emma-Harries-Social-Isolation-and-its-Relationship-to-the-Urban-Environment.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation between dense cities and social isolation</a>. The built environment of cities is designed for movement and convenience, not socialization.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/needy-millennials-want-hugs-emotional-leadership/">Those needy Millennials. Now they want hugs, too?</a>]</em></p>
<p><strong>More work, less play</strong><br />
Time is another major hurdle when it comes to making friends. Americans work more hours than the rest of the world, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaving us miserable</a> and with little time to socialize. </p>
<p>Building a friendship takes time—a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225?journalCode=spra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2018 study by Jeffrey A. Hall</a> found that it takes about 90 hours to consider someone a friend. To consider someone a close friend, it takes approximately 200 hours of time spent together. While the quantity of time is important, so is the quality of time. A quick catch-up over a cocktail isn’t the same as spending an entire lazy Sunday with a friend. It takes time to cultivate, build, and nurture relationships. So when time is at a premium, we can’t maintain our current friendships, let alone find new ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While technology makes it easier to stay connected, we still tend to have a proximity bias when it comes to making friends. As social creatures, we like to gather face-to-face and have impromptu hangouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The potential pool is both smaller and more shallow</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proximity and unplanned interaction</a> can help along friendship, which is why it can be relatively easy to make good friends throughout childhood and college. In the adult world, our pool of who we interact with on a regular basis drops down to those we work with unless we intentionally join a personal interest group or try a friendship app. </p>
<p>And finding friends as an adult in the digital age can look markedly like dating. If you’ve read <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari/dp/0143109251" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Modern Romance</a></em> or spent any amount of time on a dating app, you know that’s not easy. The “I’m so busy” culture of modern life combined with the ability to endlessly swipe, makes for a paradox of choice and no incentive to “settle” for anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we care?</strong><br />
We’ve all felt the pangs of loneliness at one time or another in our lives and know it’s no fun. But, you might be wondering, what’s the big deal? We all feel lonely sometimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick catch-up over a cocktail isn’t the same as spending an entire lazy Sunday with a friend. It takes time to cultivate, build, and nurture relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, new research is finding that chronic loneliness is bad for our health. Loneliness can raise our cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone that’s been connected to a number of <a href="https://www.cigna.com/individuals-families/health-wellness/chronic-loneliness" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detrimental health effects</a> such as depression, diabetes, sleep disorders, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Creating connection is important, though it’s hard to do, which is why many of us are leaning on technology.  </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/loneliness-epidemic/">Stemming the loneliness epidemic one interaction at a time</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Could an app help? Maybe.</h4>
<p>I recently spoke with Ronak Shah, the founder of <a href="https://serendip.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Serendip</a>, a new app that’s specifically focused on helping people make friends. Launched in May 2020 in the UK, you might think it was just serendipity that brought us such a prescient app for the pandemic times, but Serendip was more than a glimmer of an idea before the world went into lockdown.</p>
<p>According to Shah, there are two ways of making friends: the Tinder, swiping approach (think Bumble BFF) or interest groups (think Meetups). But, do either really work? Meh&#8230;only kind of. Because the swipe is just the first step in a long process. Even when you connect with someone based on shared interests, a true friendship requires something more, and deeper, than a shared hobby. Shah suggests: a soul connection. Which is why Serendip is all about connecting people with others who share their same core values to create a genuine connection and lifelong friendship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loneliness can raise our cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone that’s been connected to a number of detrimental health effects such as depression, diabetes, sleep disorders, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I spoke with Shah, I spent a couple of days exploring the app. I was immediately struck by how different it is from other, similar apps when setting up my profile. While it does ask for a photo, the photo takes up only a small portion of the real estate. And the app asks you to answer some tough questions.</p>
<p>While swiping through and matching with people, I was impressed with the care people took in filling out their profile. You’re asked to describe yourself in 3 words and then answer two ice breaker questions. These range from “The most important morals citizens should have…” to “What I enjoyed most about my childhood” to listing gratitude or causes you’re passionate about. </p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/customer-online-relationships-closer-than-ever/">From dating apps to customer relationships: we’re closer online than ever before</a>]</em></p>
<p>Then you select a question that you want others to answer—touching on things like gratitude, worries, role models, personal experiences, and even time travel. These questions function as an instant conversation starter.</p>
<p>While we were talking, Shah dropped a truth bomb: “Your job description is not your self description,” reminding me how different the app felt from the awkward first introductions at a networking party. I felt like the people I was messaging on the app were honest, deep humans with whom I could connect, not just corporate titles and marketing managers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we were talking, Shah dropped a truth bomb: “Your job description is not your self description.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We ask you questions which specifically ignore and actually push aside social constructs,” says Shah. “We do not ask you questions regarding ethnicity, nationality, religion, or political alignment. Nothing like that. It’s to get to the core of who you really are and what you really value. Then, we simply connect you with people around you who resonate with your sense of reality.”</p>
<p>And it’s working. Shah reports that the app has one one the highest messages per conversation rate, compared to other social apps. “We’re noticing that having a daily restriction on the number of people you can discover (only 5 people per day) challenges the paradox of choice theory. You&#8217;re forced to be thoughtful about each person. Judge them for who they really are and then look beyond judgement.”</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/messaging-fosters-strong-connection-4-brands-use/">How messaging fosters strong connection—and how 4 brands use it</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Genuine connection can’t be manufactured</h4>
<p>As anyone who has spent even the shortest amount of time online dating, a profile and picture do not make for a soul connection. Genuine connection requires vulnerability. </p>
<p>“It’s such a delicate process of designing and engineering a space in which you feel comfortable to be vulnerable,” says Shah. “It’s creating that trusted and safe space where you feel it’s okay to open up. And it’s actually reframing the rhetoric about friendship. Especially male friendship. This idea of bravado and not opening up about mental health and worries and struggles. We want to redefine that rhetoric. Because it’s so important to people’s mental health and well-being. It can really mean the difference for some people.”</p>
<p>While COVID-19 is keeping most friendships online right now, Shah and his team at Serendip are looking forward to releasing a new feature that encourages people to meet up IRL with their new app friends.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/technology-advances-question-means-human/">As technology advances, we question what it means to be human</a>]</em></p>
<p>Serendip will let you skip the conversation about zip codes and coffee or cocktails by automatically suggesting a mutually convenient, COVID-safe meet-up spot so you can explore your new friendship.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I’ve been lucky enough to experience the sensation of falling in love at first sight more than once. And, I don’t mean romantically. There are those special people whom I met and immediately knew, deep down, that they were soul mate material, someone I connect with on a deeper level. </p>
<p>Right now, most of us are deprived of these moments, of even having the opportunity for them to occur, so perhaps we need a little help from our technology, and our friends—our future friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been to a sales meeting and thought to yourself &mdash; &ldquo;why are we here?&rdquo; You sit and listen through a big spiel, but there&rsquo;s no real rhyme or reason to the structure of the meeting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. In fact, a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> survey found that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness">71% of senior managers</a> think meetings are unproductive and inefficient.</p>

</aside>
<p>And for sales teams, unnecessary meetings are especially damaging. Reps need as much space in their schedules as possible to communicate with prospects, so you don&rsquo;t want to waste their time.</p>
<p>Running an effective sales meeting can be a tall order, especially as teams work remotely through a pandemic. But don&rsquo;t worry, sales managers, there are some easy ways to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Get input from team members" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/get-input-from-team-members.png" /></p>
<h2>1. Get input from team members</h2>
<p>Before you meet with your sales team, ask your reps what they want to cover as a group. Team members will feel heard, which will likely boost the group&rsquo;s morale. And by gathering this input, you&rsquo;ll learn more about reps&rsquo; pain points and how they&rsquo;re handling prospects.</p>
<p>Email team members ahead of the scheduled meeting and ask them about customer challenges they would like to discuss. Or, set up a quick one-on-one chat a week or so before the meeting to understand their pain points in a little more detail.</p>
<p>Not able to collect input beforehand? Ask which customer questions they&rsquo;d like to discuss at the meeting. By hearing from every rep, you might identify recurring customer issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get input from team members is to ask them to bring three examples of customer-related inquiries or challenges to the meeting.</p>
<p>The point of bringing these examples to a meeting is to identify any recurring themes. Maybe there&rsquo;s a specific pricing issue that&rsquo;s come up for different reps while talking to prospects &mdash; that may be something important to focus on and address later.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>One of the best ways to get input from team members is to ask them to bring three examples of customer-related inquiries or challenges to the meeting.</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If the customer-related inquiry or challenge doesn&rsquo;t stretch across different team members, it could mean a more individual issue that a rep is facing. In that case, you can get more information and context from that team member after the meeting.</p>
<p>To gather input, it&rsquo;s critical that you build a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/3-pillars-effective-sales-leadership/">compassionate work environment</a> where team members feel comfortable speaking their minds. If you dismiss reps&rsquo; ideas, they&rsquo;ll likely avoid sharing their thoughts in the future. Handle these inquiries with respect (no matter how big or small), and your team members will feel like you have their backs.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Define success" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/define-success.png" /></p>
<h2>2. Define what success looks like</h2>
<p>Set a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/squad-goals-blueprint-best-sales-meeting-ever/">clear objective</a> for your meeting prior to running it, so every attendee knows how to prepare for it. This planning also saves time. The meeting will move quickly in a clear direction if everyone understands the point of the discussion.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Bonus sales meeting tip: track and celebrate wins</h3>
<p>We have a seperate Slack channel to track all wins as a team and then we bring them to our all-hands sales meeting. A fun way to celebrate those team wins remotely is using any and all Giphys!</p>
</div>
<p>Say, for example, you&rsquo;re running a forecasting meeting. Make sure team members understand the objective of the meeting, and ask that they come prepared to talk about specific KPIs. You can even put together a sales meeting agenda for activity expectations that clearly shows how many calls reps are expected to take or how much revenue they&rsquo;re expected to bring in daily or monthly.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t set vague, general goals for your sales meetings. A productive sales meeting should serve a specific function, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting specific sales KPIs for the team to track and measure</li>
<li>Updating the status of current sales projects</li>
<li>Addressing individual and overall sales challenges the team is facing</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/setting-sales-goals/">SMART framework</a>&mdash;smart, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound&mdash;to set clear meeting objectives. Make sure goals fit each of these criteria before scheduling your meeting.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Focus on one topic" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/focus-one-topic.png" /></p>
<h2>3. Focus each sales meeting around one topic</h2>
<p>Minimize general meetings that cover a wide range of areas. They tend to be unfocused, and the invite list often includes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hbr.org/2013/12/the-seven-imperatives-to-keeping-meetings-on-track">people who don&rsquo;t need to be there</a>.</p>
<p>Single-topic meetings are often easier to run. Everyone stays on track with one idea to discuss. These meetings also give reps more room in their schedules. There&rsquo;s no good reason someone should be at a sales meeting if it doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. They shouldn&rsquo;t be stepping away from their work and forced to join for the sake of sitting in.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>There’s no good reason someone should be at a sales meeting if the meeting topic doesn’t apply to them.</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When scheduling single-topic meetings, make sure that every rep gets a chance to interact with other team members. Due to COVID-19, many people are working remotely now, making these meetings all the more important. They&rsquo;re an opportunity for reps to get a bit of face time and stay connected. These interactions can also supplant random brainstorms you&rsquo;d normally have working in a full office.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Keep your sales team engaged" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/keep-sales-team-engaged.png" /></p>
<h2>4. Keep your sales team engaged</h2>
<p>When <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uptickapp.com/blog/the-brutal-economics-of-disengaged-employees">employees are disengaged,</a> your business suffers. Low team morale often means low productivity. Not to mention, the cost of employee turnover can range anywhere from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gnapartners.com/article/how-much-does-employee-turnover-really-cost-your-business/">75-150% of their annual salary</a>.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, it&rsquo;s in your company&rsquo;s best interests to make sure your sales team stays invested.</p>
<p>Design meetings in ways that keep reps feeling invested in your team. In the world of COVID-19, that means working around remote communication.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<h3>Bonus sales meeting tip: seed the conversation</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a virtual sales meeting, ask questions prior to the meeting. Sometimes I will prep individuals with what I&rsquo;m going to ask so they can think of a good response to promote deeper conversation.</p>
</div>
<p>For a one-on-one meeting, you might allow reps to call in by phone for a casual conversation away from the computer. Your remote reps are likely feeling <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue#:~:text=Finally%2C%20%E2%80%9CZoom%20fatigue%E2%80%9D%20stems,to%20look%20at%20the%20camera.&amp;text=This%20is%20because%20having%20to,makes%20us%20uncomfortable%20%E2%80%94%20and%20tired.">Zoom fatigue</a> with so many video chats, so they&rsquo;ll probably appreciate having this flexibility. You might even suggest they walk around the block to get some fresh air as you chat.</p>
<p>Along with one-on-ones, set up regular video &ldquo;water cooler chats&rdquo; where sales reps chat about their lives outside of the company. Team members will likely feel more engaged if they get to know each other personally. Ideally, these chats will give reps a taste of normal office banter and help them feel more connected to team members.</p>
<h2>Keep a flexible mindset toward sales meetings</h2>
<p>Sales meetings require structure, but the order doesn&rsquo;t have to remain static. Feel free to adapt your sales meetings based on your team members&rsquo; schedules and workloads.</p>
<p>This flexibility is especially important when your sales team is busy and stressed. Check in individually with your team members to see how they&rsquo;re doing, and gauge whether a calendar invite will add to their anxiety. Approaching meetings with this compassion can go a long way toward making your reps feel supported.</p>

<p>The truth is, being a sales rep takes more than just being an extrovert or using the right &ldquo;key words&rdquo; in an interview. The best salespeople need a balance of personality traits to keep a happy, calm demeanor and find solutions&mdash;even when leads are challenging.</p>
<p>As a manager, it&rsquo;s your job to understand what makes a good salesperson. More importantly, you need to know how to identify those sales personality traits in potential new hires.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Sharon Prosser<strong>,</strong> VP of Worldwide SMB Sales at Zendesk, and Justin Van Kleeck, VP of Global Sales Development at Zendesk. We wanted to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the personality traits of top-performing sales reps?</li>
<li>How do you assess candidates based on these traits?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about what they look for in a salesperson.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Goal-oriented" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/goal-oriented-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>1. Goal-oriented</h2>
<p>The life of a sales agent involves working to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/setting-sales-goals/">meet goals and quotas</a> month after month. If you aren&rsquo;t driven by goals, you aren&rsquo;t going to thrive in a sales environment. Period.</p>
<p>So how do you determine whether a sales rep is goal-oriented? When Justin interviews candidates, he asks them to give real-life examples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have [candidates] give real-life examples, even if they&rsquo;re personal, of how they pursue their goals,&rdquo; Justin says. &ldquo;Ask, what was the last goal you set for yourself? How did you approach it? What steps did you take to achieve it? Who did you share it with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can also ask a potential sales hire about their future goals. Where do they see themselves in five or ten years? Goal-oriented people will be able to tell you the specific benchmarks they&rsquo;re working toward, along with how they plan to achieve those goals.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Resilient" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/resilient-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>2. Resilient</h2>
<p>Rejection is a reality of sales. It&rsquo;s unavoidable when you&rsquo;re reaching out to over 50 people per day.</p>
<p>The best salespeople don&rsquo;t take &ldquo;no&rdquo; personally. They use logic to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/overcome-common-sales-objections/">understand <em>why</em> a prospect said no</a>, and then they adjust their strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>Sharon encourages her candidates and reps to <em>&ldquo;</em>get smart about why [the deal] was rejected.<em>&rdquo;</em> Was it timing, cost, or something else?</p>
<p>Ask your candidate to tell you about a time when they lost a deal. Pay attention to how they relay the experience. They should be able to tell you what they learned from the experience and how they implemented that knowledge in future sales interactions.</p>
<p>The best salespeople are resilient in the face of rejection. Hearing &ldquo;no&rdquo; should be motivation to try harder.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Accountable" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/accountable-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>3. Accountable</h2>
<p>When it comes to meeting quotas&mdash;or dealing with failure&mdash;great salespeople hold themselves accountable. After all, you can&rsquo;t meet team quotas if one rep is constantly making excuses for coming up short. Your reps should take responsibility for their contribution to a team, even if that means admitting failure.</p>
<p>To assess a rep for this sales personality trait, ask them about a time they made a mistake that affected their team or organization. For example, maybe they missed an easy sales opportunity because they forgot to follow up with a hot lead. They should take responsibility for that failure and be able to explain what they could have done better.</p>
<p>Being unable to easily give you an example is a red flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find most successful salespeople are going to be a harder critic on themselves,&rdquo; Justin says. &ldquo;When you dig a layer or two deeper with having people provide examples, if they&rsquo;re not being genuine, that becomes apparent fairly quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Curious" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/curious-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>4. Curious</h2>
<p>Curiosity is what drives sales reps to truly understand a prospect&rsquo;s situation. The best salespeople are invested in getting to know their lead as an individual, with unique needs and pain points. Not only does this establish trust and rapport with a prospect, but it also gives reps the context they need to close a sale.</p>
<p>Ask your candidates to talk about how they manage the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/build-sales-crm-process/">initial stages of the sales cycle</a> (prospecting and qualifying). What types of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-questions-close-deal/">sales questions</a> do they ask to understand a prospect&rsquo;s goals? How do they identify the roadblocks preventing those prospects from achieving their goals?</p>
<p>Curious salespeople will &ldquo;ask the same question five different times/ways to truly understand a situation,&rdquo; Sharon says. The more understood your leads feel, the more likely they&rsquo;ll be to invest in your company&rsquo;s solutions.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Outgoing" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/outgoing-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>5. Outgoing</h2>
<p>Sales reps reach out to people all day, every day. If they don&rsquo;t enjoy being outgoing, they&rsquo;ll likely burn out quickly.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can tell if a candidate lacks this sales personality trait just by interacting with them face-to-face. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.inc.com/travis-bradberry/8-great-tricks-for-reading-peoples-body-language.html">Physical cues</a> like crossed arms or lack of eye contact can mean the rep is uncomfortable with social interactions. For these candidates, reaching out to leads all day will likely be draining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phone starts to weigh 500 pounds, and they dread picking it up in the morning,&rdquo; Justin says.</p>
<p>Find your extroverts by asking applicants what they like to do in their spare time. You might ask how they recharge after a long week. If the answer is &ldquo;Get together with friends&rdquo; or &ldquo;Meet new people,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s likely that person would thrive in a sales environment.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Competitive" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/competitive-personality-trait.png" /></p>
<h2>6. Competitive</h2>
<p>Sales is a highly competitive industry. If you aren&rsquo;t motivated by the desire to win, you&rsquo;re not going to be successful in a sales role.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s also important to be a team player. Sometimes, winning a deal for your company requires tapping into the resources and knowledge of other reps. &ldquo;Selling is a team sport, hands down. If you are a lone ranger, you&rsquo;re going to fall short,&rdquo; Sharon says.</p>
<p>To gauge your candidate&rsquo;s level of competitiveness, ask, &ldquo;Would you classify yourself as someone who loves to win or hates to lose?&rdquo; Highly competitive people are going to have a stronger reaction to losing, because <strong>they</strong> <strong>expect to win</strong>. Anything less is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Just remember, your reps should be willing to work together if it means a win for the company. Ask your potential hires about a time when they helped a coworker. If they can&rsquo;t think of an example, it might mean they&rsquo;re unwilling to be a team player.</p>
<h2>Defining the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; sales personality</h2>
<p>As a sales manager, it&rsquo;s your job to understand what makes a good rep. Consider Justin and Sharon&rsquo;s advice to evaluate whether job candidates have the right traits for the job. You&rsquo;ll be well on your way to building a strong sales team by following these industry leaders&rsquo; tips.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think the hard work ends once you&rsquo;ve landed a customer. In reality, the struggle to win your clients&rsquo; hearts is only just beginning.</p>
<p>After you make a sale, your business needs to keep showing the customer that your product is valuable. Whether you succeed or not comes down to the team you have promoting your products and growing the customer relationship. That&rsquo;s where a customer success manager comes in.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you should know about hiring a customer success manager&mdash;and why you&#8217;re missing out if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is a customer success manager?</h2>
<p>Customer success managers (CSMs) support your customers as they transition from sales prospects to active users of your products.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re focused on building close long-term client relationships, and often stay with the same customers as long as they continue to work with your business.</p>
</div>
<p>Customer service reps react as problems come up, but CSMs work to fix issues before they happen. They proactively look out for their customers&rsquo; business, suggesting new and innovative ways to keep them succeeding with your products.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever gone out to eat and were overwhelmed by the menu? And what you really want is someone to help you decide? That&rsquo;s how I view [Customer] Success,&rdquo; explains Delores Cooper, Customer Success Associate at Zendesk. &ldquo;[We] look at the picture in its entirety; what will provide immediate gratification as well as long term stability. Success members accompany the customer on their journey and stick around for the entire lifecycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Customer success vs customer service" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/customer-success-vs-customer-service.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Differences between customer success and customer service. [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/customer-success-vs-customer-service/#.XzRRXC3My01">Source</a>]</p>
<p>Customer success departments are a pretty new trend. Their popularity has skyrocketed as companies began seeing value in investing in customer relationships. A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zs.com/insights/what-is-a-customer-success-manager">2019 survey</a> by ZS Consulting found that over 40% of high-tech companies now have CSMs.</p>
<h2>What makes a good customer success manager?</h2>
<p>Customer success managers should have strong organization and presentation skills, but those things can be taught, explains Cooper. The real power of a great CSM comes from their soft skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A propensity for relationship building, and doing it quickly, is [very] valuable,&rdquo; says Cooper. &ldquo;The customer needs to trust your product and industry knowledge, trust that you understand their use case, and trust that your recommendations really are in their best interest. It&rsquo;s not enough to just have a knack for it; it&rsquo;s important to really enjoy forming and maintaining relationships. You can&rsquo;t pretend, otherwise they&rsquo;ll see right through it and you&rsquo;ve done more harm than good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Empathy is also essential, Cooper adds. You have to be able to connect with your customer over both their successess and frustrations to develop a long-term bond.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;We’ve all been customers at some point or another, but being able to draw on those experiences, both positive and negative, and use them to create your own personal CSM methodology is a remarkable skill to have.&rdquo;<br />
<cite>Delores Cooper, Customer Success Associate at Zendesk</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why do you need a customer success manager?</h2>
<p>Customer success managers unify your sales and support teams. Because they&#8217;re part of many stages of the customer relationship, they have a high-level view of the customer lifecycle. They use this perspective to add value for your customers&mdash;and your company.</p>
<h3>CSMs bridge the gap between sales and customer support</h3>
<p>Customer success managers are both salespeople and support professionals. But they aren&rsquo;t focused on winning the next account or putting out individual fires. They&rsquo;re relationship managers that both expand customer accounts and solve customer issues.</p>
<p>There are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.groovehq.com/support/great-examples-of-customer-onboarding">two key milestones</a> in the customer lifecycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>When buyers sign up</li>
<li>When they achieve their first success</li>
</ol>
<p>Each customer will define this moment of success differently. Sometimes it&rsquo;s financial, like exceeding their targeted monthly revenues thanks to your product. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a smaller personal success, like realizing your product saves them time.</p>
<p>Either way, the space between these milestones is the most common place for <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-churn-rate/">churn</a>. After the initial excitement wears off, buyers have to learn how to use the product. Without the right team in place to guide the process, customers are likely to get frustrated and lose interest.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vitally.io/blog/posts/5-tips-for-a-successful-sales-to-customer-success-handoff/">Customer success picks up where sales leaves off</a> at this critical juncture. They become your customer&#8217;s mentors. CSM&#8217;s main goal is to get them started as fast as possible and monitor their satisfaction as they grow.</p>
<h3>They focus on adding value and reducing churn</h3>
<p>Having a customer success manager overseeing the onboarding process helps with <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies/">retention</a>. But the relationship goes beyond onboarding.</p>
<p>CSMs check in with their clients to make sure they&rsquo;re consistently using the products. This intervention is surprisingly necessary; regular product usage often doesn&#8217;t happen organically. An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/saas-customer-acquisition/">Invesp study </a>found that half of all paying customers log into their SaaS products once a month or less. It can be hard to keep clients engaged if they aren&rsquo;t seeing the value in your products. Customer success managers work to keep those benefits top of mind.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Customer SaaS login stat" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/customer-saas-login-stat.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Customer success managers keep your clients engaged and regularly using your products. [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/saas-customer-acquisition/">Source</a>]</p>
<h3>They have a &#8220;high-level view&#8221; of the entire support process</h3>
<p>Customer success managers are involved in multiple phases of the customer lifestyle, so they have a bird&rsquo;s eye perspective. Service reps may know what customer problems are most common, but they only see the issue up close. CSMs see which problems affect multiple clients, and forecast what those trends mean for future churn.</p>
<p>Success managers also have a unique view of future product upgrades and changes. They can advocate for their customers by connecting the clients&rsquo; wishes to the business&rsquo; larger strategy.</p>
<p>Say, for example, a CSM notices that many clients are asking for a similar product update. They can justify the strategic importance of this update to product managers. That way, the improvement is made, and users are kept happy.</p>
<p>Their high-level view enables CSMs to see potential problems and turn them into saved dollars&mdash;for their clients and your business.</p>
<h2>3 key responsibilities of a customer success manager</h2>
<p>A customer success manager is responsible for the health of your customer relationships. They offer product solutions to pain points, and find opportunities to expand your business.</p>
<h3>Long-term customer relationship management</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2019/02/19/the-secret-sauce-fueling-the-next-wave-of-intelligent-technology-is-not-what-you-think/#9edbc0445383">IDC</a> predicts that by 2022, 53% of all software revenue will come from subscriptions. As more businesses switch, the buying model is shifting from one-time purchasing to repeat/monthly sales.</p>
<p>That means customer relationship goals have to shift, too. The new goal is to keep customers <em>continuously</em> happy, not just happy enough to make a single purchase. This focus on relationship marketing differentiates customer success managers from other customer support professionals.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="Transactional marketing vs relationship marketing" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/transactional-marketing-vs-relationship-marketing.png" /></p>
<p class="caption">Customer success managers are your relationship marketing experts. [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/relationship-marketing/">Source</a>].</p>
<p>Sales and service reps focus on customers&rsquo; short-term happiness; CSMs focus on adding value for years to come. Their commitment doesn&rsquo;t end when a customer signs up&mdash;that&rsquo;s when it begins.</p>
<p>Customer success managers own the relationship marketing process. They check in with customers regularly to develop an open line of communication, so concerns can be promptly heard and addressed.</p>
<h3>Brand and product promotion</h3>
<p>CSMs generate excitement for new or developing products by keeping clients updated on their progress. As new products come available, they facilitate demos and training. If customers decide to add new products to their plans, success managers help implement them.</p>
<p>CSMs can to find upsell opportunities organically because they&rsquo;ve taken the time to understand their client&rsquo;s use-case and earn their trust. That personal relationship makes all the difference in finding and positioning expansion opportunities.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also able to provide the technical product support and training necessary to keep their customers happy. This is especially important during onboarding, when CSMs work closely with customers to make sure their adoption of the product goes smoothly.</p>
<h3>Proactive problem resolution</h3>
<p>Customer success managers look out for their customer&rsquo;s business and work with them to find solutions to pain points. It&rsquo;s their job to put out the flame before it&rsquo;s a wildfire. They monitor their <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/measuring-customer-happiness/">customers&rsquo; happiness</a> closely so they&rsquo;re able to offer solutions before issues occur.</p>
<p>CSMs check in with their clients monthly, if not weekly, and ask directed questions to gauge their satisfaction. They can compare these conversations with customer&rsquo;s behavioral data&mdash;like how often clients are logging in to your company&rsquo;s software&mdash;to assess their overall happiness.</p>
<p>If a customer success manager sees any red flags, they can act immediately to fix the problem before it becomes a complaint. The first step may be as simple as calling a client for a check-in, or offering to do a lunch-and-learn for the client&rsquo;s staff about the product. This intervention feels natural to the client since customer success managers already have a regular, open line of communication with them.</p>
<h2>Improve your customer relationships by hiring a customer success manager</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s customers expect more than products that meet their needs. They expect <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail#">personalized support</a> from professionals who care about customer goals.</p>
<p>This expectation makes customer success managers invaluable. With this role, your company has someone who has a deep understanding of clients&rsquo; needs. The CSM internalizes and shares feedback, so the organization knows how to deliver a product or service that their audience wants.</p>

<p>Asking questions is a crucial way for reps to build rapport with sales prospects. But it&rsquo;s hard to know what the right questions are to ask. You want to learn more about the lead, but you don&rsquo;t want to come across as robotic or pushy.</p>
<p>The SPIN sales methodology teaches reps how to pick the questions with the most impact. By using this sales technique, you&rsquo;ll be able to overcome objections and close more sales.</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h2>What is SPIN selling?</h2>
<p>SPIN is a sales technique designed to help sales reps close difficult, complicated deals. The acronym SPIN represents the categories Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff.</p>
<p>When practicing SPIN selling, reps ask questions that fall into these categories during the different stages of the sale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation questions</strong> help reps learn more about the prospect&rsquo;s current state. They&rsquo;re asked during the opening stage of a sale.</li>
<li><strong>Problem questions</strong> probe prospects&rsquo; frustrations and pain points. These are asked while in the investigation stage.</li>
<li><strong>Implication questions</strong> give the prospect a chance to relate their frustrations with the previous stage&rsquo;s problems. These are asked in the phase in which you demonstrate the value of your product or offering.</li>
<li><strong>Need-Payoff questions</strong> ask the buyer how important or urgent it is for them to solve their problem and the benefit of solving it. These are asked in the final closing phase of the sale.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Neil Rackham introduced the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/which-popular-sales-methodology-is-right-for-you/">methodology</a> in his 1988 book <em>SPIN Selling</em>. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070511136" rel="noopener noreferrer">the book</a>, Rackham outlines a framework for developing and timing structured questions sales reps should ask to close a deal. Each question fits into one of the four above categories.</p>
<p><em>SPIN Selling</em> was written over three decades ago when researching leads took greater time and effort. With today&rsquo;s search engines and social networks, there&rsquo;s no excuse for asking basic questions like &ldquo;how many employees does your organization have?&rdquo; Do your research on prospects beforehand, so you&rsquo;re ready to ask meaningful questions.</p>
<p>To make the sales process as seamless as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipate any objections leads may have about your product</li>
<li>Give them the information they&rsquo;ll need to share with their colleagues and stakeholders to evaluate your business</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="lazyload no-src" alt="4 stages of SPIN selling" data-src="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/images/blog/spin-selling-4-stages.png" /></p>
<h2>The 4 stages of SPIN selling</h2>
<p>In the SPIN selling methodology, there are four stages to each sale:</p>
<ol class="bordered">
<li>Opening</li>
<li>Investigating</li>
<li>Demonstrating capability</li>
<li>Obtaining commitment</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages build off one another. They could happen throughout one sales call or over several months of interactions. Each category of SPIN questions corresponds with a stage of the sale.</p>
<p class="supertitle center">Stage #1</p>
<h3 class="center">Opening</h3>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<div class="grid centered">

<div class="col col-small-8">
<ul>
<li>In the beginning, don&#8217;t push your product</li>
<li>Focus on building a sincere relationship</li>
<li>Gather as much information as you can</li>
<li>Ask questions and show interest in your leads</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<h3>Build a relationship to open the sale</h3>
<p>In the beginning, reps shouldn&rsquo;t push their products on leads. Instead, focus on gradually building a sincere relationship. Gather as much information as you can about prospects, their role, and their frustrations.</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
Showing a sincere interest in your leads will help you build rapport with them.
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&rsquo;re selling time-tracking software, and you meet a brand-new lead. At this point, don&rsquo;t dive in by telling them how much more productive your software can make their team. Instead, collect information by asking questions. Showing a sincere interest in your leads will help you build rapport with them.</p>
<p class="supertitle center">Stage #2</p>
<h3 class="center">Investigating</h3>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<div class="grid centered">
<div class="row">
<div class="col col-small-2" style="display: flex;">
        <img src="https://web-assets.zendesk.com/images/p-support-variant/icon-sliders.svg" style="height: 60px; align-self: center;" />
      </div>
<div class="col col-small-8">
<ul>
<li>Find out what&#8217;s frustrated leads in the past</li>
<li>Investigate pain points to build trust and credibility</li>
<li>Reassure leads that you have their best interests in mind</li>
<li>Overcome objections</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</div>
<h3>Investigate pain points to build trust and credibility</h3>
<p>In the previous stage, you started creating a genuine relationship with the prospect. In this stage, you&rsquo;ll go even further by asking questions to uncover information about the prospect&#8217;s problems (that your product can solve). By digging into the lead&rsquo;s challenges, you&rsquo;ll establish yourself as knowledgeable, credible, and trustworthy.</p>
<p>In our time-tracking software example, a sales rep might ask the prospect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What issues do you have with your current processes for time-tracking?</li>
<li>How time-consuming or cost-prohibitive is it for your team to track their time accurately?</li>
<li>Has your current time-tracking process ever failed?</li>
<li>What are the biggest challenges your company faces with tracking time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand what has frustrated leads in the past, and you&rsquo;ll be ready to explain why your product won&rsquo;t involve those roadblocks.</p>
<p class="supertitle center">Stage #3</p>
<h3 class="center">Demonstrating capability</h3>

<h3>Demonstrate why your product is valuable</h3>
<p>At this point, the prospect is ready to hear how your product can solve their pain points. Walk them through your product&rsquo;s features to explain different ways it could help their organization.</p>
<p>Say, for example, the prospect mentioned that their company has a distributed workforce. You might highlight that your software is cloud-based, so users can access their data from any device worldwide.</p>

<h2>34 SPIN selling questions to use during your next sales call</h2>
<p>Gently nudge prospects towards making a purchase by asking these SPIN-stage-specific questions.</p>
<h3>Situation questions</h3>
<p>At the Situation stage, be sure to gather any information you need to help you address and overcome future objections. Avoid asking the prospect basic questions that you can quickly answer through research.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you currently do [insert process]?</li>
<li>Why does your company take this approach?</li>
<li>What is your budget for [insert process]?</li>
<li>How important to your organization is [insert process]?</li>
<li>What tools do you use to support [insert process]?</li>
<li>Who does [insert process] the most? What do they need?</li>
<li>How often do you have to do [insert process]?</li>
<li>How much [insert resource] do you typically use in a given day/week/month?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problem questions</h3>
<p>Based on Situation stage answers, Problem questions ask about the prospect&rsquo;s goals and roadblocks. This conversation should help the prospect realize current and future issues that your product could help solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>How cost-prohibitive is it to do [insert process]?</li>
<li>Are you satisfied with your processes for [insert operation]?</li>
<li>Do these processes ever fail?</li>
<li>How time-consuming is it to do [insert process]?</li>
<li>Have you ever run out of [insert resource]?</li>
<li>Have you ever been unable to access [insert resource]?</li>
<li>Has a previous interruption in [insert process or operation] cost you resources?</li>
<li>Has the cost of [insert process or resource] ever kept you from [insert operation]?</li>
<li>Who is responsible for handling issues that arise with [insert process or operation]? How does it impact their workload?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the biggest challenge your organization faces with [insert process or operation]?</li>
<li>What are the disadvantages of your current processes for [insert operation]?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implication questions</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.inflexion-point.com/blog/neil-rackham-reveals-the-changing-face-of-selling-and-updates-spin">research by Neil Rackham</a>, prospects find Implication questions to be the most stimulating and thought-provoking. He also found that the highest-performing salespeople ask <strong>four times as many Implication questions</strong> as their average-performing colleagues.</p>
<p>Push leads towards making a purchase by asking these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What resources does it cost to do [insert process] this way?</li>
<li>If you had more resources, what could you accomplish?</li>
<li>How would you use more funds (be as specific as you can) each quarter?</li>
<li>How is your issue with [insert process or resource] impacting your team?</li>
<li>Does [insert process] ever keep you from reaching your business goals?</li>
<li>Without your problem with [insert process or resource], would it be easier for you to reach your goals?</li>
<li>If [insert process or operation] didn&rsquo;t ever occur, what would happen?</li>
<li>Have you had this problem with [insert process or resource] in the past?</li>
<li>Where do you find you have the most bottlenecks with [insert process or resource]?</li>
<li>Are there any hidden costs for training, equipment, etc., associated with [insert process or resource]?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Need-Payoff questions</h3>
<p>Ask Need-Payoff questions to communicate the usefulness of your product or service. If you&rsquo;re successful, these questions will help the prospect realize your business&#8217;s value, and they&rsquo;ll convert.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would doing [insert process] make it easier to reach your business goals?</li>
<li>Would you find it valuable to do [insert process]?</li>
<li>Do you think that resolving your issue with [insert process or resource] would help your organization?</li>
<li>Why is being able to do [insert process or operation] important to your organization?</li>
<li>How do you think a solution for [insert process or resource] would help your team?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your prospects are talking &ndash; are you listening?</h2>
<p>Sales reps have a reputation for one-sided conversations where they go on about their products instead of listening to the lead. The SPIN selling method challenges that approach.</p>
<p>With its carefully crafted questions, SPIN puts listening to prospects at the forefront of sales conversations. Integrate these questions into future sales calls to build deeper connections with leads and move them through your pipeline.</p>
<p>Share the visual below with your sales team so they can see:</p>

<li>Questions that they can ask to have better conversations.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you start your first company, one of the most critical but often overlooked roles you take on is that of a chief salesperson. For many founders, this is uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Pitching an investor is not the same as convincing a customer. If you want to <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-hire-your-first-sales-rep.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hire your first sales rep</a> and close more deals, you need to understand how the sales process works, what tools your team needs to be successful, and of course, learn to speak the language of sales.</p>
<p>Fortunately, sales is a skill that can be learned. Let&#8217;s start with the basics:</p>

<p><span id="1"></p>
<h2>Sales definitions you should know</h2>
<p>Before you can <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/create-sales-crm-strategy/">develop a CRM strategy</a> for your startup, you need to know the lingo. </p>
<p>Sales terminology might feel unfamiliar or even a bit rigid at first, but the beautiful thing about using <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-guide/">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> software for sales is that it provides common structure for a <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/build-sales-crm-process/">sales process</a>. With a few exceptions, most CRMs follow the same basic rules using similar vernacular. These basic rules can also apply to the way a recruiting or fundraising process might work. </p>
<p>Here is a glossary of key terms you should know: </p>
<div class="accent-box accent-oat">
<h3>Key terms and definitions</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-crm/">Sales CRM</a></strong> — Software used to streamline pipeline management and safely store customer information, communicate with prospects, and drive more sales.</p>
<p><strong>CRM objects</strong> — Represent the sales relationship you have with a specific person or company. There are four primary CRM objects: leads, accounts, contacts, and deals.</p>
<ul class="bordered">
<li>
<p><strong>Leads</strong> — Sales prospects generated through marketing, research, or outreach that have not yet been vetted through the lead qualification process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounts</strong> — A group containing multiple contacts or potential deals. In B2B sales, it typically represents a company. In B2C sales, it may be a household.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contacts</strong> — People within a group who you communicate with, which includes information such as their phone number and email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deals</strong> — Potential sales opportunities. You may have multiple deals and contacts under the same account, or you may have a single contact and deal.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lead qualification process</strong> — The vetting process to determine whether a lead is likely to be converted and become a customer. </p>
<ul class="bordered">
<li>
<p><strong>Qualified lead</strong> — A prospect who is likely to be a potential customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unqualified lead</strong> — A prospect who is not likely to be a potential customer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><a class="button button-medium button-primary-default" href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/crm-process/">Guide to the CRM process</a></div>
</p></div>
<p><span id="2"></p>
<h2>The importance of qualifying your leads</h2>
<p>Understandably, you might be eager to reach out to any and every lead that comes to you, but determining which leads are your ideal prospect (qualified) and those who aren’t (unqualified) is an important step in the sales process. </p>
<p>The lead qualification process serves two important purposes: </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><strong>Evaluating marketing efforts</strong>: You can determine whether your marketing efforts are attracting ideal prospects, so you can start spending your advertising dollars more wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Setting sales team priorities</strong>: Properly tracking leads allows you to divide and conquer; some can work on qualifying leads while others focus on converting leads after they are qualified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qualifying leads before you try to sell to them is critical. If you don’t qualify leads first, you could be reaching out to contacts who are unlikely to buy from you. That’s not only frustrating for your sales team, it’s not a good investment of your time and resources.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a pool cleaning business and your marketing efforts drum up a lead from someone who doesn’t own a pool, that would be an unqualified lead. If the lead is indeed a homeowner with a pool, then the lead is qualified and has the potential to be converted into a sale. </p>
<p>This is important because if you spend $1,000 in your marketing efforts (paid media ad placements, email blasts, and more) to generate 100 leads but can&#8217;t close any deals, you need to understand why. Lead qualification can help you spot where the problem is and try to address it. </p>
<p>Then it’s up to you to do something about it, but as a founder, that’s a feeling you’re probably used to. </p>
<p><span id="3"></p>
<h2>Benefits of a sales process</h2>
<p>Implementing a formal sales process with defined stages has a few  key benefits: </p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li><strong>Pipeline snapshot: </strong> Stages help you know how many potential sales you have, how far along all the potential sales in your pipeline are and how close they are to closing.</li>
<li><strong>Process coordination:</strong> Stages allow you to organize the tasks and assign responsibilities as deals progress through a pipeline, especially in complex sales requiring multiple team members.</li>
<li><strong>Sales forecasting:</strong> Over time, as you analyze your sales data, you should be able to determine a percentage likelihood of deals closing at each stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stages of your sales pipeline are unique to your business and it is best to get some advice from sales leaders in similar industries on how to structure your deal stages. That said, CRMs can help by providing a default structure that vary from simple to complex. </p>
<p>Read on for more information about how deal stages are typically structured in a sales pipeline. </p>
<p><span id="4"></p>
<h2>Sales pipeline step-by-step process</h2>
<p>As your company grows, you’ll want to evaluate how effective your sales process is by <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-pipeline-track/">tracking your sales pipeline</a>. </p>
<p>Sales pipeline management is the process of predicting how many upcoming deals you have and how likely they are to close. These forecasts are an important budgeting tool. They can help you identify gaps in your pipeline, so you can address them before they become big problems.  </p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step guide to the sales pipeline process:</p>
<div class="accent-box accent-tofu">
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Prospecting</h4>
<p>Create targeted lists of potential customers. CRMs can help streamline the research process and fill in key contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Qualifying</h4>
<p>Identify whether leads are likely to become customers, what their needs are, and who their key decision makers are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Quoting</h4>
<p>Craft a proposal to share with decision-makers, which typically includes the value proposition, price information, terms, and conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Contracting</h4>
<p>Prospect reviews the proposal internally, and if desired, terms can be negotiated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Won/Lost</h4>
<p>If the prospect accepts, they sign a contract and the deal is considered won. If they choose not to accept the deal, then it’s lost.
</p>

<h2>5 tips for developing a sales process for your startup</h2>
<p>While it’s important to understand the fundamentals of the sales process, every company has its own unique needs and challenges. Now is the time to apply what you’ve learned and design a sales process that will help your sales team close more deals, and hopefully, have a good time doing it. </p>
<p>When developing a sales process for your startup, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>1. Know what metrics you want to track</h3>
<p>Design your sales process so you can report on key metrics. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will your investors want to see from you?</li>
<li>How will you demonstrate your accomplishments in your next VC pitch?</li>
<li>What will motivate your employees to stick around?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Collect the right information without slowing down the team</h3>
<p>When possible, automate data collection as much as you can and try to minimize clicks. As a startup founder, you may want to participate in the sales process yourself, so you can empathize with your team and help them do their jobs as efficiently as possible.</p>
<h3>3. Be thoughtful about how you organize your lead sources</h3>
<p>You may only have one or two lead sources today, but that number will grow over time. You don’t want to be in the habit of changing lead source data retroactively to fit your reporting structure. Lead source examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic search</li>
<li>Paid advertisement</li>
<li>Email marketing</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Web referral</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Evaluate your sales process regularly</h3>
<p>Nothing is set in stone. As your organization evolves, ensure that your sales process and stages are suited to how your sales team operates and what your needs are for tracking your business.</p>
<h3>5. Look to the future</h3>
<p>You may not know it when you start, but over time, you should be able to calculate probabilities of closing a sale at each stage. For this reason, it’s important to regularly revisit and update your stage probabilities to improve your forecasting.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the sales team</h2>
<p>Watching your business grow over time is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an entrepreneur, and you can’t do that without a sales process. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the day-to-day of building a product, raising money and growing your team. You take for granted that sales will happen, but actually, it takes a lot of effort and strategy to close deals. </p>
<p>Now that you understand the sales process, your next job as chief salesperson will be finding a CRM solution that’s equipped to meet your needs, and hopefully, one that can adapt and grow with you as your business changes over time. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all started when Covid-19 was first bearing down on the globe. All of our employees were feeling the strain. Some had gone into isolation practically overnight and, even in those early days, were suffering from loneliness. Other employees were in shared apartments in big cities without much in the way of parks or green space. They did not have the space or quiet to work, or ways to decompress from the pressure. Still others found that quarantine was a blessing in disguise—they got to spend time in their beautiful homes, and taking zoom calls while their children played in the yard.</p>
<p>Then the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor galvanized America and truly the rest of the world. People took to the streets in record numbers to say, Enough. At Zendesk, we made a public statement: <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/values-action-zendesk-will-continue-better/">We can’t stay silent</a>. </p>
<p>The same storms were blowing across the world—and our employees were weathering them, but in very different boats.</p>
<h2>The big idea: empathy out loud</h2>
<p>We felt an urgent need to find a way to support our employees. The empathy circle idea emerged, although the name didn’t come until later on. In an initial brainstorm, one of my colleagues said, “Those of us in the employee groups are always talking. But it’s the same sets of people confiding in each other. We have all these echo chambers in our employee resource groups.” </p>
<p>Philosophically, we all align on the concept of empathy, a core Zendesk value and yet, we felt that we had to shatter the echo chambers, and bring leadership into the fold, <em>to listen</em>. </p>
<p>We were eager to create forums, in different regions, to talk about exactly this reality — that each of us approaches the same situation in different ways, because we are different people in different situations. And we had to act quickly: Waiting on the sidelines, waiting out these crises, was not an option. Our people were hurting. They needed safe spaces where they could talk and vent, cry, and talk. </p>
<p>Coming up with solutions was not the central goal: Rather, we wanted to build an opportunity for our employees to speak their hearts and their minds, if only to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling terrible&#8221;—to create listening sessions that would be absolutely safe. </p>
<section>
<div class="container grid">
<div class="col col-small-9 push-medium-1">
<blockquote><p>
        “Empathy is very important. Everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about. Be kind always.”<br />
        <cite>A Zendesk employee, during an Empathy Circle, 2020</cite>
      </p></blockquote></div>
</p></div>
</section>
<h2>Easier said than done</h2>
<p>The conversations were bound to be raw and at times uncomfortable. How do you address the dichotomy- of leaders who want to ‘solve’ and employees who want them to ‘listen’ first. Listening is not typically considered as an action by most of us. </p>
<p>We set out to amplify two of our core values: being humble and bringing empathy to life. The end goal: get people to talk openly and in a vulnerable way about their experiences, lived experiences both inside and outside of Zendesk. And for leaders to listen and learn. That&#8217;s the first step towards empathy. You can&#8217;t empathize with something that you don’t understand—that’s sympathy, not empathy.</p>
<h2>The leadership of listening</h2>
<p>It was critical for our leaders to participate, but not in their expected capacity of keynote speakers—rather, as listeners. A very different role for many executives: going into a discussion, completely vulnerable, not being in charge, and being open to just listening, not talking. But that quiet visibility would have its own immense power—it would speak volumes without a single word.</p>
</ul>

<p>People worry: &#8220;Can we be vulnerable? Can we share our stories and not be judged? Will there be retaliation against us because we shared stories?&#8221; This is what it takes to make them comfortable.</p>
<ul class="bordered">
<li>
<h6>Confirm non-retaliation</h6>
<p>We had our Legal and HR representatives set the tone upfront by calling out our legal non-retaliation policy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Communicate anonymity</h6>
<p>Promise your employees that nothing will be recorded and the conversation is off the record. However be transparent that we will take anonymous notes. Our collective stories and experiences make the company richer. But unattributed. Make your people comfortable with this. Tell them, &#8220;Our leaders are here to listen and learn from you. Nobody&#8217;s judging you.&#8221;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>An empathy arena</h2>
<p>In America, for our first empathy circle, we prioritized our Black colleagues. Our topic was bold: Racism in America. We worked behind the scenes with our Mosaic employee group leaders to say, This is your space. That was also quite a lot of orchestration behind the scenes because there were white people who were genuinely hurting. There were parents who were saying, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be raising racist children.&#8221; We worked with our all our employees to say, we know you&#8217;re hurting too, but this privilege and this space belongs to our Black colleagues. Let us be humble and let us listen.</p>
<p>This first session was scheduled for 90 minutes; it went on for two hours plus. We were expecting 25-50 colleagues and we had over 250 joining including our CEO and our topmost leaders. The stories shared, the vulnerability of our colleagues and that of our leaders, it was all truly a humbling experience. As the event kicked into gear, a colleague slacked me: “Wow, this is not an empathy circle, it’s an arena!” And indeed it was—an arena built of our colleagues’ bold vulnerability. In stepping up to share their stories, they exemplified the determination, the authenticity, and the trust at Zendesk.</p>

</ul>
<h4>A global event for a global company</h4>
<p>We went on to host a total of five global circles bringing together 800-plus employees across APAC, EMEA, LATAM and AMERICA. At each empathy circle, we followed ground rules.</p>
<ul class="list-check-circle-fill">
<li>Respect</li>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Discomfort</li>
<p>Every circle had its own nuance, and we kicked off with stories of our local moderators. These were brilliantly authentic leaders in the regions who set the tone of each circle with their personal experience sharing and true to the spirit and our promise on anonymity, we never shared any names, only stories.
        </ul>

</ul>
</ul>
<h4>How to plan an empathy circle</h4>
<p>What follows are key steps. <a href="http://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/1-Empathy%20Circles%20Playbook.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click here for an in-depth playbook.</a></p>
<ul class="bordered">
<li>
<h6>Plan well ahead</h6>
<p>There’s a method to holding a successful empathy circle. Employee emotions are central, but an empathy circle can’t run off emotion alone. The infrastructure has to be right. The prep work has to be right. The people who are speaking up need to be lined up at least so that they know they&#8217;re ready to share the story. Awkward silence begets more awkward silence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Representation matters</h6>
<p>When you see someone who looks like you, who comes from your background, and speaks up authentically, that might give you the courage to open up. We saw that happening over and over again in all our empathy circles.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Have local leaders facilitate</h6>
<p>Another factor in the success of our empathy circles: This was a truly leader-led initiative. While the DEI team was there behind the scenes, planning and orchestrating, we reached out to people who are thought leaders within the organization. Enabling leaders to own their stories empowered everyone to speak up. We set up local leaders as facilitators and enabled them to step into the space with humility and confidence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Global view is an imperative</h6>
<p>We carefully researched topics for each region. Intersectionality of race, class, immigration, religion and more in Europe &#038; Latin America was a big topic and Racism &#038; gender equality Asia is very different from how these topics are discussed in America. Context setting is critical. The research we did behind the scenes got the co-facilitators ready to comfortably talk about this topic.
</p>
</li>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Allow time and space</h6>
<p>These are difficult and complex topics. Opening the space is only the first step. You must plan for care resources and offer time and space after the sessions, for colleagues who were brave enough to share their stories.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>From a moment to a movement</h2>
<p>We have created a quiet movement here at Zendesk. In our own authentic way, we have opened up space for thousands of colleagues across the world to connect in this physically distant and disrupted pandemic world. As we wrapped up last week, we launched our very first employee group to support our colleagues and their families with disabilities—mental, intellectual, physical—visible and invisible. As the group WholeSelf launched, their new executive sponsor and hundreds of colleagues stepped in with their own authentic stories with bold vulnerability. It truly set the stage for our global employee base to connect with each other at a level that would not have been possible before.</p>
<p>For us this is an inspiring example of how empathy came to life here at Zendesk on its own, leader led and truly organic. </p>
<p>Simple, humble, and beautiful—this movement has been powerful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something’s not working. Maybe your business didn’t take off like you thought it would; or it’s not designed to function in a pandemic. Maybe you signed on for a career not realizing that you’re temperamentally unsuited for the industry. Maybe you love half your job and hate the other half. Whatever it is, the idea of starting over from scratch is so hard. It’s easy to wonder:  What if the next thing doesn’t work any better? But this is the moment for a pivot.</p>
<p>When you pivot, you keep one foot rooted to something in your situation that still makes sense, while you begin to change direction. One pivot might lead to another, and another, until eventually you find yourself in a new place without having made a terrifying leap of faith to get there. The pivot is a move everyone should master, because between pandemics and common variety business disruptions, pivoting has become an essential skill.</p>
<h4>Changing course as a company</h4>
<p>Mauro F. Guillén, a professor of international management at Wharton School, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-businesses-have-successfully-pivoted-during-the-pandemic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote an article for Harvard Business Review</a> on how businesses have successfully pivoted during the pandemic. He also wrote a book called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084F986RN/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#038;btkr=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything</a>.</em></p>
<p>He noted in a phone interview that when people see a big change coming, they tend to do one of two things: nothing, hoping it will pass, or think “‘I have to transform everything from top-to-bottom, inside-and-out.’ Neither of those is the best way to approach a situation. The pivot lets you think incrementally, keep your options open, so you don’t make a decision that’s irreversible,” he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One pivot might lead to another, and another, until eventually you find yourself in a new place without having made a terrifying leap of faith to get there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, he recommends trying to look at your business through a different lens. Restaurants coping with COVID-19 that see themselves as sit-down eating establishments could change their perspective, to view themselves now as a kitchen. Perhaps they can get creative and design a subscription business where they provide a certain number of dishes each week to customers. Or offer a package deal with a few other area restaurants for weekly subscriptions. Restaurants could research whether there are any particular health benefits people in the area specifically crave and address those with their food offerings. The point is, none of these changes are  irreversible should they want to return to being a sit-down restaurant in the eventual wake of the pandemic. In the meantime, making one of these changes might prove a lucrative new vertical.</p>
<p>Another example Guillén gave is IBM, which pivoted from being a producer of hardware to a consulting firm. Instead of selling products, IBM now sells solutions. But the company still relied on the knowledge and skills it gained from it’s long history; it just applied that knowledge in a different way.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pivot is a move everyone should master, because between pandemics and common variety business disruptions, pivoting has become an essential skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article “<a href="https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/how-to-pivot-your-business-stay-resilient.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to Pivot Your Business and Stay Resilient</a>,” business coach Bruce Eckfeldt points out that there are two ways to pivot a business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find new products, services, or delivery approaches for existing customers</li>
<li>Find new customers for existing products and services</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/4-companies-talk-cx-changing-course-managing-expectations/">4 companies talk CX, changing course, and managing expectations</a>]</em></p>
<p>If you have deep relationships with a loyal customer base, for example, you can find ways to solve their problems beyond your existing products or services. Say you run a fitness club and COVID-19 hit your business hard. You could implement <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/cleaning-and-disinfection-of-environmental-surfaces-inthe-context-of-covid-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stringent cleaning requirements</a>, as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many hotels have done</a>, and schedule a few customers at a time. You could create a fitness circuit so you could manage the cleaning of equipment between customers. You could offer online fitness classes tailored for specific groups and suggest diet plans. The important question is: What do your customers really need and how can you pivot to provide it?</p>
<p>The other way to go, Eckfeldt said, is to find new customers for existing products and services. “One of my favorite examples is Gore,” he wrote, “which started with making high tech fabrics but branched out and found all sorts of applications for its material technology in medical, biotech, automotive, and electronics. They even figured out that their waterproof fabric product Gore-Tex works great as dental floss which is now sold as the product Oral-B Glide.”</p>

<h4>Making a career pivot</h4>
<p>Sometimes you’re not pivoting a business; you’re pivoting your own career. I have helped Career Pivot coach Marc Miller write several editions of his book: <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLDRPDK/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&#038;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQVU1WlVCTFpRTTlCJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTc1MjE1Vk0xU0FDRkE2N0QxJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1OTY3ODQyQjFLUzRZWkdOTVFSJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfaHFwX3NoYXJlZCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Repurpose Your Career: A Practical Guide for the Second Half of Life</a></em>. We wrote the first version when he started his life as a career coach, shortly after the economic crash of 2008. A lot of people over 50 had lost their pensions, savings, and opportunity to retire, but didn’t want to go back to their old jobs—or couldn’t. By the second edition, Miller had been approached by a lot of people under 50, GenXers who had reached their career goals and felt like, “Now what?” and added to the first book with advice specifically for them. The third edition had to do with perpetual disruption, the gig economy, and ageism, though I know at least a couple of Millennial and GenZ readers who found the practical advice really helpful to guide their career choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important question is: What do your customers really need and how can you pivot to provide it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miller had what he calls a “moment of clarity” in the form of a near-fatal bicycle accident— the experience helped him realize that he was sleep-walking through his career and he wanted to do something more meaningful. The world is experiencing a similar moment of clarity right now because of COVID-19. But Miller explains that people shouldn’t just throw out their old lives and lunge for a new one. They have to take stock first. They need to begin from their current education, job skills, and experience, but also assess their history for clues about what makes them feel fulfilled and enthusiastic about a particular kind of work or environment. </p>
<p>For example, are you someone who loves to work on only one project or are you a multi-tasker? What makes a good team, in your experience? What kind of working environment is optimal? What level of physicality do you need? And what is this current moment of crisis teaching you about the path you’ve been on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Miller explains that people shouldn’t just throw out their old lives and lunge for a new one. They have to take stock first. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among Miller’s clients have been a sales expert who pivoted to becoming a metro rail pilot and then pivoted again to start his own drone business, and a singer who went into HR and now does data visualization. His clients and their paths have been so varied that you begin to see a world of possibilities.</p>
<p><em>[Related read: <a href="http://relate.zendesk.com/articles/consumer-trends-great-reset-want-move-forward/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Consumer trends during The Great Reset: How do we want to move forward?</a>]</em></p>
<h4>Listen to your gut but lean on the data</h4>
<p>Pivoting may be easier than making a wholesale transformation, but it’s not easy. Both Miller and Guillén recommend that pivoters collect a lot of data before making a pivot. This will instill the confidence you need to move in the chosen direction and will help shore you up through challenges. Many people, Miller has observed, jump into a new career or job thinking it will be the antidote to the problems of the last one. But because they didn’t do the research, they discover they are in as bad or worse a situation than the one they left. The data can tell a lot about whether a business will work or whether a career shift will succeed.</p>
<p>Stories about <a href="https://medium.com/steveglaveski/an-staaethe-top-10-company-pivots-of-all-time-adfd049c99c0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">famous pivots</a> can also be encouraging, too. Like how Paypal started out intending to “beam IOUs” from Palm Pilot to Palm Pilot; and how PlayDoh was once a wall cleaner; and how <a href="https://www.getflow.com/blog/the-pivot-mindset" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram was going to be a basic social media site</a> but the data told the company to focus on photos.</p>
<p>COVID-19 will bring a host of changes, even though some things will return to “normal.” But uncertainty and change seem to be the atmosphere in which most people live these days, so having the ability to pivot  in the face of change means that you can continue moving in a direction of your choosing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How well is your call center handling customer issues?</p>
<p>Metrics like customer survey scores and average hold times speak volumes about your support team&rsquo;s performance. But even data doesn&rsquo;t always tell you the full story.</p>
<p>To uncover the finer details of your call center performance, you&rsquo;ll need a headset and a quick tutorial on call listening, or <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/features/call-monitoring/">call monitoring</a>. It&rsquo;s the process of listening to customer calls to assess reps&rsquo; communication skills and find potential improvement areas&mdash;often in real time.</p>
<h2>Why should I care about call listening?</h2>
<p>Running a call center without call listening is like conducting an orchestra with earmuffs on. Tone and tempo matter, and you need to be able to hear when someone&rsquo;s not hitting the right notes.</p>
<p>There are some things you just need to hear for yourself. Metrics reports are good for charting KPIs, but they won&rsquo;t tell you why a conversation ran long or ended abruptly. Even call transcripts can&rsquo;t capture demeanor, clarity, and other nuances. And neither option allows you to do a live check-in on an active call.</p>
<p>There are several reasons you might want to keep an ear on your support agents, from quality assurance to active training.</p>
<h3>Monitoring performance</h3>
<p>Does one of your agents consistently have poor performance metrics&mdash;like low customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores or lackluster first-call resolution (FCR) rates? Try listening to some of their conversations. The calls will likely reveal the root of the problem, whether it&rsquo;s product knowledge, service speed, or demeanor.</p>
<p>The results might end up surprising you. For example, if an agent&rsquo;s average hold time (AHT) is high, that may seem like cause for concern. But call listening could reveal that their calls are long because the agent is thorough and asks great follow-up questions.</p>
<p>High-performing agents are also worth a listen. Monitor the service rep with the highest CSAT scores and you may discover the secret to their success&mdash;which you can then share with the rest of the team.</p>
<h3>Training new or struggling agents</h3>
<p>Customer service reps require hands-on training, even if they&rsquo;re wearing hands-free headsets. Call listening is the best way to guide new or struggling support agents through challenging calls. Give real-time advice, or take notes during the call. Afterward, you can go over what they did well and where they need to improve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to record calls for training purposes, as well. Save examples of exceptional (and exceptionally bad) customer calls, and use them to illustrate the dos and don&rsquo;ts of customer service. (If you&rsquo;re going to share examples of what <em>not</em> to do, you should probably only use recordings of <em>former</em> employees. That way, you&#8217;ll avoid embarrassing a team member in front of their colleagues).</p>
<aside>
<blockquote><p>
Call listening is the best way to guide new or struggling support agents through challenging calls.
</p></blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some training processes include &ldquo;mock calls&rdquo; for new hires. While a simulated situation works fine as a test run, agents also need to be familiar with the real deal. The more call recordings you have, the more examples you can give trainees of what to actually expect when they put on a headset.</p>
<h3>Intervening to provide better service</h3>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll feel the need to interrupt a call you&rsquo;re monitoring. It&rsquo;s especially common during the training phase when service reps struggle to answer customer questions.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let an inexperienced service rep flounder on a call, even if it could be a &ldquo;learning experience&rdquo; for them. The mission is always to resolve a customer&rsquo;s issue as quickly and efficiently as possible, even if that means taking matters into your own headset.</p>
<h2>Two ways to start call listening</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever called a busy customer service hotline, a pre-recorded voice has probably told you, &ldquo;this call may be monitored or recorded for quality-assurance purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may not have interested you much at the time, but those are the two main methods of call listening&mdash;monitoring a conversation live and recording it for later.</p>
<p>We get it&mdash;call listening isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable thing in the world, especially if you&rsquo;re new to it. But there&rsquo;s a great (and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lieberandassociates.com/Resources/kbase/Call-Recording-and-Monitoring-Laws-for-Call-Centers.html">mandatory</a>) way to shake the sensation that you&rsquo;re eavesdropping: always acknowledge up front that &ldquo;this call may be monitored or recorded for quality-assurance purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard it a million times, and so have your customers. They&rsquo;re used to it, and will appreciate the improved support that results.</p>
<h3>Getting it on the record</h3>
<p>Some support agents might prefer that their managers record customer calls rather than listen to them live. It can be less stressful to review the conversation after the fact than to have your boss evaluate you in real time.</p>
<p>Plus, recorded calls make great educational resources for agents. Instead of quickly sharing feedback during a live call, you can fully explain mistakes agents made by pausing the recording. Call recordings can also double as examples for other agents-in-training.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/talk/#overview">cloud-based contact centers</a> are able to record customer calls. Some CRM systems can even <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/213857708-Managing-call-recording-options-in-Talk">automatically connect call recordings</a> to corresponding support tickets, so agents can easily find them. If an agent needs to forward a support ticket to someone else, the call recording could provide helpful context.</p>
<h3>Going live</h3>
<p>Live call monitoring allows you to intervene and potentially improve the customer&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>There are three methods of live call listening. Each one calls for a different level of supervisor involvement:</p>
<ol class="list-num-circle">
<li>
<h4>Snoop</h4>
<p>A supervisor can silently listen to a call after it&rsquo;s already started, without the agent or customer knowing. This method limits a supervisor&rsquo;s ability to give advice but may make the agents less nervous if they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re being monitored.</p>
<p>This type of call listening may feel a bit sneaky, but this is a good way of assessing an agent&rsquo;s typical performance. They won&rsquo;t be trying to impress you, so you&rsquo;ll get an accurate impression of their calls. Besides, if agents know that <em>any</em> call could be monitored, it may inspire them to step up their game on <em>every</em> call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Whisper</h4>
<p>A supervisor listening to the call can speak to the agent without the customer hearing, as if whispering advice in their ear.</p>
<p>This is basically the &ldquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrano_de_Bergerac_(play)"><em>Cyrano</em> <em>de Bergerac</em></a> Approach,&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re hiding in the bushes and feeding lines to someone else. (If you prefer movies from the 1980s to plays from the 1800s, you can call it the &ldquo;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxanne_(film)"><em>Roxanne</em></a> Approach&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Barge</h4>
<p>A supervisor listening to the call can join in and start communicating with both the agent and the customer at any time.</p>
<p>This method is perfect when agents are still in training, since there&rsquo;s a decent chance you&rsquo;ll need to &ldquo;barge in&rdquo; and guide the call. In general, it&rsquo;s good to have this intervention option on calls for times when you know you can resolve a customer&rsquo;s issue faster than the agent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that live call listening and call recording are not mutually exclusive options. With the right software, you can record customer calls <em>and </em>snoop, whisper, or barge into select conversations.</p>
<p>Just remember to inform every caller up front that the conversation &ldquo;may be monitored or recorded.&rdquo; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lieberandassociates.com/Resources/kbase/Call-Recording-and-Monitoring-Laws-for-Call-Centers.html">Some states</a> legally require this notification (and you could <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ifrahlaw.com/ftc-beat/wells-fargo-learns-that-recording-calls-in-california-can-be-costly/">pay big fines</a> if you forget it).</p>
<h2>Hear us out&mdash;call listening software is a sound investment</h2>
<p>Call listening is about tracking performance <em>and</em> training agents to be better. Why not find a software solution that empowers you to do both?</p>
